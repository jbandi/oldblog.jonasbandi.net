<em>The following question and solution is from the preparation for the Sun Certfied Enterprise Architect (SCEA) from the Sun Learning Center:</em>
<br/>
<br/>
You have the assignment to create a new architecture that will be used by your organization for all future web development.

Which three characteristics are important when choosing a web application framework? (Choose three.)
<list>
<li>
A) Billing rates of framework consultants.
</li>
<li>
B) Code re-use.
</li>
<li>
C) Ease of Use.
</li>
<li>
D) It was featured in a computer magazine.
</li>
<li>
E) Industry acceptance.
</li>
<li>
F) We write our own web frameworks.
</li>
</list>

<br/>
The solution:
<br/>
Options B, C, E are correct. 
Options A,D are incorrect because they are not valid architectural concerns. 
Option F is incorrect because this is generally not the best solution as existing frameworks are well refined.
<br/>
<br/>
They didn't get the joke:
<br/>
<blockquote style="font-size:14px">I don't think you can count someone even as a semi-decent java dev until he wrote his very own web framework at least once in his life.</blockquote>
