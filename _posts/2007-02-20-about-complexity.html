<p>This picture is from a presentation from Anton Böhm of <a href="http://itserve.ch/home.html">IT Serve</a>, given at a guest lecture at <a href="http://www.sws.bfh.ch/">SWS.</a></p><p><a href="http://www.sws.bfh.ch/">
</a></p>I think this picture can be interpreted in many ways. The thought that jumped into my head, was the following:

<p>For a long time software development fought with performance. Performance was the limiting factor for a lot of software systems. The picture shows that complexity of IT-systems is growing much faster than performance. So nowadays the limiting factor for the development of an IT-system is the complexity and not performance any more.</p><p>
</p>So managing complexity should become the primary focus of software development. There is a need for concepts and technologies/tools/frameworks that help us to get a grip on complexity-management. I think Object-Relational-Mapping, Domain Driven Design, Dependency Injection and Aspect Oriented Programming are steps in this direction. These concepts battle complexity by applying Separation of Concerns, intuitive Modeling and abstraction.

<p>Another trend is Model Driven Architecture and Model Driven Design. I am not yet convinced by these methodologies, since in my opinion they rely too much on tools, which leads just to another dimension of complexity… but I am looking forward to <a href="http://berner-architekten-treffen.ch/treffen.html">get enlighted </a>;-)</p>
