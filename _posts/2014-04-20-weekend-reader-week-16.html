Is anybody expecting a clear path from plumber to architect in the construction analogy?</p><p>Are architects just a concept to offer developers a career path?</p><p>I have been in the industry for a long time now, and I did not see two companies/projects where “Architect” had the same interpretation. But do we really need architects? I am sceptical … I would argue that we need people that care about stuff. And not everybody can care about everything, so the “Architect” should care more about the high-level, holistic perspective while others care more about low-level perspectives. But I doubt there should be a clear path that leads from the one to the other. It’s just an agreement that somebody should care about this and somebody else should care about that.</p><p>And the role of an architect in Agile is another interesting topic:</p><p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/52325469" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0"></iframe></p><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/52325469">Putting an architect in a scrum team is like putting mayonaise in cake - Christin Gorman</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/rootsconf">Roots conference</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p><p> </p><h3><a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/02/21/WhereIsTheForeman.html">About the Foreman</a></h3><p>Uncle Bob (Robert Martin, one of the authors of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>) has some come up with an interesting interesting idea: Software projects needs a foreman. In the initial proposal of Uncle Bob, the foreman is the only person that commits code to the project, other developers send him pull requests. In a follow-up post '<a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/02/23/OhForemanWhereArtThou.html">Oh Foreman, Where art Thou?</a>’ Uncle Bob relaxes his initial proposal a bit: The foreman has the ultimate responsibility over every commit, but others might commit directly.</p><p>For me this is a drastic departure away from the notion of an empowered, self-organizing team that is the foundation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile software development</a>. In my opinion, if we introduce the notion of the foreman, then we build a big obstacle in fostering an intrinsically motivated, self-organising and responsbility-embracing team and take a big step back towards tayloristic understanding to work and responsibilities. I don’t believe the tayloristic approach fits an industry relying on knowledge workers.</p><p> </p><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f60dheI4ARg">The obligatory quote of Steve Jobs: </a></h3><blockquote><p>Great companies have to be run by ideas not by hierarchy.

When I started my career over a decade ago, the big challenges for a programmer seemed to be in big enterprise systems. Nowadays the big challenges and innovation seems mostly to be in consumer facing applications on the web and in mobile.</p><p>The most tragic manifestation of the descent of the enterprise is <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn640687.aspx">the “Enterprise Mode” in Internet Explorer 11</a>, which basically allows enterprises to remain in the stone-age of Internet Explorer 8.</p><p>The notion  of "the Enterprise" already became a running gag in the industry:</p><p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/codinghorror">Jeff Attwood</a><span> on </span><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/02/podcast-41/">Stackoverflow Podcast 41.</a></p><blockquote>In corporate environments the product don't have to be good. Sometimes they don't even have to exist ... if you are a thoughtful developer, you are in the wrong place!</blockquote><p> </p><p><a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/25459">The Story of Ashton</a><span> by </span><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/spolsky">Joel Spolsky</a>:</p><blockquote>On the morning of his two year anniversary at the cubicle company, Ashton was driving to work when he realized something.<br />
Not one line of code that he had written had ever run.<br />
