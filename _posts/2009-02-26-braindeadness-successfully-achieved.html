Today it was finally confirmed, that my <a href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2008/09/certification-to-become-braindead.html">journey to braindeadness</a> was successful ... Im officially a <em>Sun Certified Enterprise Architect for the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 5</em> ... 
<br/>
<br/>
Actually it was quite a challenge, because even though my brain was already proven dead, I had to personally ask Sun support because it was not confirmed on <a href="http://www.certmanager.net/sun">certmanager</a> after six weeks ... supposedly there were technical problems preventing my automated step into zombie land ...
<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had already reached the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_beliefs_and_practices#Survival_and_the_Dynamics">next level of salvation</a>, and could actually make <a href="http://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/2009/02/rails-maturity-model.html">sarcastic comments</a> about my achievements... oh wait, did I just do that? ... braindead ...
