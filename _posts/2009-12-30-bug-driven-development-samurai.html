In his <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/bdd-and-ddd">presentation</a> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development">Behavior Driven Development (BDD)</a> and <a href="http://www.domaindrivendesign.org/">Domain Driven Design  (DDD)</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/tastapod">Dan North</a> talks about another interpretation of "BDD": <em>Bug Driven Development</em> or "DDD": <em>Defect Driven Development</em>.
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>It goes like this:</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
The customer comes to the developer and wants the perfect system. He describes what he wants, but its this fuzzy vision described in a business language that the developer just is not able to grasp...
<br/>
<br/>
<em>The developer</em>: "Ah ok... I understand. It is done!"
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Customer</em>: "What? What do you mean?"
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Dev</em>: "Well it is done. The system is finished!"
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Customer</em>: "Well, no ... I don't see an icon where I can start the system?"
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Dev</em>: "Oh! You are right. That's a bug! I will fix it."
<br/>
<br/>
<em>... five minutes later ...</em>
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Dev</em>: "Ok, the icon is here. Now it is done!"
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Customer</em>: "Well, no! When I double-click the icon nothing happens!"
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Dev</em>: "Oh! You are right. Thats a bug! I will fix it."
<br/>
<br/>
<em>... five minutes later ...</em>
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Dev</em>: "Ok, the the app starts when you double click. Now it is done!"
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Customer</em>: "Well, no! There is nothing in the newly opened window!"
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Dev</em>: "Oh! You are right. Thats a bug! I will fix it."
<br/>
<br/>
<em>... you get the idea.</em>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While this is a humorous story, it actually demonstrates the qualities that BDD (now Behavior Driven Development again) strives for:
<br/>
<list>
<li><em>Pull based</em> instead of push based: The developer pulls new requirements from the business just in time when they are needed.</li>
<li><em>Outside-in</em>: The development is driven by the business relevant features that are actually used and matter to the stakeholder.</li>

<li><em>Constant involvement</em> of the customer.</li>

<li>Small steps with clear <em>acceptance criterias</em>.</li>
</list>
<br/>

Another analogy is funny:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development">Behavior Driven Development</a> is an evolvement from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Driven_Development">Test Driven Development</a>, taking the concepts of the latter to a higher level, evolving out of a purely developer-centered discipline.
<br/>
<br/>
The same could be said for <em>Bug Driven Development</em>: The concept of <em>Samurai Debugging</em> was already a humorous technique in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming">Extreme Programming</a>:

<blockquote>When you follow the Samurai Debugging technique, you start with a blank screen. That's not what you want, so you start debugging it, and you continue debugging it until your program does exactly what you want it to do.</blockquote>

<br/>
Now Bug Driven Development takes this to the next level by involving the customer :-).
