<p> This short speech from JavaZone 2011 is just ingenious! It really made me laugh out lout again and again.<br /> I can fully recommend to watch the video (it's only 9 min), you will be amused, even if you don't know much about hibernate...<br /> <br /> <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/28885655" width="500" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <a href="http://vimeo.com/28885655">Hibernate should be to programmers what cake mixes are to bakers: beneath their dignity.</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/javazone">JavaZone</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.<br />

Favorite quotes:</p>
<blockquote>Frameworks like Hibernate leave you with pretty much exactly the same amount of work you had to do anyway, only now you are not enjoying it at all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I present to you: Hibernate - the naked emperor's hairy butt-cheeks!</blockquote>
<blockquote>If Hibernate was a part of your team, you wouldn't even let him anywhere near your database.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We used to write algorithms, now we are writing annotations. Are we meant to be happy about that?</blockquote>
