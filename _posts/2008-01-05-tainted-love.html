This is meant as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/wesdyer/archive/2007/01/18/why-functional-programming-is-important-in-a-mixed-environment.aspx">an argument</a> in favor for functional programming.

<br />




<br />

I think that moving away from an imperative statement-oriented style towards a declarative expression-oriented style does indeed help us not to fall into the vicious write-debug-circle. I mean, do you debug your SQL-expressions?

<br />
<br />




On the other hand, isn't the possibility to assemble a complex program from simplest instructions the strength of imperative languages? Is it only my brain that has repeatedly problems to wrap itself around ever growing, conceptionally twisted SQL-expressions? I thought it was a common agreement, that SQL is hard to maintain? I would put a big part of the blame on its declarative style, that does hardly allow decomposition or modularization... and I am a bit afraid of seeing mainstream application languages moving in this direction.

<br />
<br />




And somewhere out there is still lurking the danger of <a href="http://closed-loop.blogspot.com/2007/03/about-writing-code.html">ready-only languages</a>.
