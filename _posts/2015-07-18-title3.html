<h3 id="the-software-paradox"><a href="http://thesoftwareparadox.com/">The Software Paradox</a></h3>

<p>A short book about the rise and fall of the commercial software market.</p>



<h3 id="product-backlog-bankruptcy"><a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/product-backlog-bankruptcy">Product Backlog Bankruptcy!</a></h3>

<p>I have been in teams where the effort to maintain (the illusion of) a backlog was just rediculous … the idea to declare the product backlog bankruptcy makes sense to me.</p>

<h3 id="agile-scrum-go-mainstream"><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2015/06/14/coding-agile-scrum-go-mainstream/">Agile &amp; Scrum Go Mainstream</a></h3>

<p>Ok, many teams in software development have moved past the scrum hype … but general management seems to just start discovering it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scrum is a Copernican revolution in management.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>… I remain sceptical.</p>

<h3 id="monolith-first"><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html">Monolith First</a></h3>

<p>Martin Fowler about the current hype around microservices:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You shouldn’t start a new project with microservices, even if you’re <br>
  sure your application will be big enough to make it worthwhile.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="microservices-and-javaee-no-paradox">Microservices and JavaEE: No paradox?</h3>

<p>JavaEE desperately tries to be fashIonable by squeezing traditional application servers in the corset of microservices … I wonder if this is a good aproach: <br>

<h3 id="the-birth-and-death-of-javascript"><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript">The birth and death of JavaScript</a></h3>

<p>Another great talk (<a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">WAT</a> is a classic!) by Gary Bernhard. Watch out for the point where he crosses from reality to fiction …</p>

<h3 id="some-people-seem-pretty-crazy"><a href="https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html">Some people seem pretty crazy</a></h3>

<p>How <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> uses computers: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I usually fetch web pages from other sites by sending mail to a <br>
  program that fetches them, and then mails them back to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am in awe at all the obstacles he is willing to take on by staying true to his principles.</p>

<h3 id="funny-introducing-atom-10"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7aEiVwBAdk">Funny: Introducing Atom 1.0</a></h3>

<p>Atom is the text editor from GitHub based on <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">web-technologies</a>.</p>
