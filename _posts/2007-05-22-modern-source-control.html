<p>The latest <a href="http://dotnetrocks.com/">DotNetRocks</a> is about Source-Control and Continuous Integration with Martin Woodward and Eric Sink.</p>
<p>There are some funny statements :</p>
<p><em>Eric:</em> &hellip; most modern source control systems &hellip;<br /><em>Richard:</em> &hellip;and the only thing you have got in the&nbsp;&lsquo;non-modern&rsquo; is VisualSourceSafe? Anything else?<br /><em>Eric:</em> I cant think of any other off the top of my head.</p>
<p>&hellip; later on:</p>
<p><em>Martin</em>: CruiseControl has a workaround for missing atomic commits.<br /><em>Eric:</em> The fact that I know that now diminishes me!</p>
<p>&hellip; some more:</p>
<p><em>Martin:</em> You have forgotten how hard it is to work with SourceSafe, you have been working with Vault for too long!<br /><em>Eric:</em> That was an intentional forgetting! You are dredging it up!</p>
<p>The main point they are making (besides SourceSafe-bashing) is:&nbsp;A modern source-control system should support a true <em>edit-merge-commit</em> model and <em>atomic commits</em>.</p>
