<p>I was just reading my self-prescripted daily dose of blog-posts, when the truth caught up with me and destroyed my carefully-crafted self-image!</p>
<p>It all started when I&nbsp;stumbled across <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000838.html">this post</a>. </p>
<p>The post is quite interesting, since it breaks with the current <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/success-stories/">Rails-hype</a> (is this a sign, that <a href="http://rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a>&nbsp;has reached the top of the <a href="http://www.gartner.com/pages/story.php.id.8795.s.8.jsp">hype cycle</a>? I hope not, I just ordered my first Rails-book from Amazon&hellip;)</p>
<p>The background of the&nbsp;above post is <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>&hellip; and now I get to the point of my post: <strong>I don't get it! </strong>What is this Twitter all about?</p>
<p>I desperately try to be hip and&nbsp;trendy!&nbsp;I am eagerly using <a href="http://del.icio.us/s">delicious</a>, <a href="http://mail.google.com/">gmail</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">google-reader</a> but obviously this is all in vain. I have to face the hard truth: I am not of the Web-2.0&ndash;Generation!</p>
