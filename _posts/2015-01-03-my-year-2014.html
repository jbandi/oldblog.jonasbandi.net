<p>My year 2014 was interesting and brought many changes from a professional and personal perspective.</p>

<h3 id="from-the-personal-perspective">From the personal perspective …</h3>

<p>I had two great vacations: I was literally beginning the year under water on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jbandi/sets/72157641628637623/">a great dive trip in Raja Ampat</a>. Diving with oceanic mantas was something I will never forget:</p>

<p>And <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jbandi/sets/72157645215658965/">my mountainbiking vacation in Colorado/Utah</a> was another extraordinary experience:</p>

<p>However the probably much more profound event in my personal life came in October with the birth of our first child:</p>

<h3 id="from-the-professional-perspective">From the professional perspective …</h3>

<p>I started to do much more teaching in 2014. My engagement at the Berner Fachhochschule was expanded and I am teaching a mayor part in the new <a href="http://www.ti.bfh.ch/cas-html5">CAS (Course of Advanced Studies) “Multiplatform Development with HTML5”</a> and a smaller part in the <a href="http://www.ti.bfh.ch/en/weiterbildung/informatik_it/cas_angebot/cas_md">CAS Mobile Application Development</a>.</p>

<p>During the year I was giving quite a lot of inhouse courses for JavaScript development and AngularJS. These courses range from 1 day bootcamps to 4 day workshops. I held courses for <a href="http://www.ubs.com/">UBS</a>, <a href="http://www.bit.admin.ch/">BIT</a>, <a href="http://www.puzzle.ch/">Puzzle ITC</a>, <a href="http://www.glue.ch/">Glue</a>, <a href="http://www.ims.ch/">IMS AG</a>, <a href="http://enterprisesoftwaregroup.com/#/">ESGroup</a> and I could again give my JavaScript Bootcamp twice at the <a href="http://www.ch-open.ch/wstage/workshop-tage/">ch/open Workshoptage</a>.</p>

<p>I enjoy working in the emerging space of <strong>“JavaScript as a serious application platform”</strong> so much, that I quit my job as a architect at my <a href="http://www.cgm.com/ch/index.de.jsp">former employer</a>. I am now working as a freelance developer and trainer with my own company. <br>
The adoption of JavaScript in enterprise application development is the area I am currently focusing on. </p>

<p>In the typical educational institutions JavaScript is still pinned to the space of “Web-Design”. Apart from that there are almost no public courses to learn professional JavaScript development. Thats where I try to offer my <strong>inhouse courses</strong>: I specifically target typical enterprise environments and enterprise developers (Java or .NET) and I try to show the similarities between the modern JavaScript ecosystem and the traditional enterprise plaforms and also the pitfalls of JavaScript. I am offering courses for professional JavaScript development, for <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, for <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and for architecting modern html5 based frontends for enterprise systems.  But I always tailor my courses to the specific needs of the individual team. </p>

<p>For the coming months I have already engagements for courses at <a href="https://www.postfinance.ch/">Postfinance</a> and at <a href="https://www.mobi.ch">Mobiliar</a> and I am looking forward to work with more teams. If you are interested in setting up a JavaScript/AngularJS/React course or coaching for a development team, please <a href="mailto:network@jonasbandi.net">contact me</a>.</p>

<p>There are also <strong>public courses</strong> scheduled, where I will be teaching:</p>

<ul>
<li>Digicomp: <a href="https://www.digicomp.ch/de/weiterbildung/softwareentwicklung/web-und-mobile-app-entwicklung/webentwicklung/einfuehrung-in-die-frontend-entwicklung-mit-javascript-und-angularjs">Einführung in die Frontend-Entwicklung mit JavaScript und AngularJS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbv.ch/de/bbv-academy">BBV Academy: Professional JavaScript Development for Java &amp; .NET Developers</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Starting from April I will also be looking for opportunities to work hands-on in interesting projects. Of course my preference would be to work in projects where JavaScript and enterprise systems intersect.</p>
