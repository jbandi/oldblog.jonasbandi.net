<p>Highly recommended: the first 5 minutes of Dan North reading from the Book of Geek. Its funny and poignant:</p>
<blockquote>In the beginning the software was without form, and void.<br /> The Architects said "Let there be light" and they separated the light from the darkness.<br /> And they called the light Architecture and the darkness Hacking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>And Maven brought forth a Plague of Apache Commons, and there was a flood of all the Libraries of the Internet as a judgement upon the people.</blockquote>
