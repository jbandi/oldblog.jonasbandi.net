<h3 id="swissjs-was-great"><a href="http://www.swissjs.com/">SwissJS</a> was Great!</h3>

<p>Here are some good summaries: <br>

<h3 id="history-of-icons"><a href="https://historyoficons.com/">History of Icons</a></h3>

<p>A visual brief on icon history through different graphical user interfaces in different operating systems. <br>
A neat site that reminds us how time is passing …</p>



<h3 id="startup-timelines"><a href="http://www.startuptimelines.org/">Startup Timelines</a></h3>

<p>Another site that reminds us how time is passing … </p>



<h3 id="assessing-employee-performance-youre-doing-it-rong"><a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/assessing-employee-performance-1a8bdee45c1a">Assessing Employee Performance: You’re Doing it Rong</a></h3>

<p>Some interesting thoughts about tracking value and a lot of bashing of issue trackers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ironically, the best way to get fired for underperformance is to be a 10x developer.</p>

<h3 id="feature-toggles-are-one-of-the-worst-kinds-of-technical-debt"><a href="http://swreflections.blogspot.ca/2014/08/feature-toggles-are-one-of-worst-kinds.html">Feature Toggles are one of the worst kinds of Technical Debt</a></h3>

<p>Feature toggles are a (better) alternative to excessive feature branching, but guess what, they have their own problems … so we keep looking for the silver bullet.</p>

<h3 id="why-you-might-not-need-mvc"><a href="http://www.code-experience.com/why-you-might-not-need-mvc-with-reactjs/">Why you might not need MVC</a></h3>

<p>React.js was critizising MVC from the beginning. I never understood the argumentation against MVC, 2-way-binding and the need for the Flux architecture. This article helped me to understand some of the concepts behind that argumentation.</p>



<h3 id="the-container-revolution"><a href="http://www.theplatform.net/2015/07/21/containers-for-the-masses-now-that-kubernetes-is-set-free/">The container revolution</a></h3>

<p>A good writeup about how container technologies evolved and the consequences.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That means your developers can move faster, you can ship faster, you can iterate faster, your business grows faster – speed improves everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="this-developers-life-is-back"><a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/">This Developers Life is back</a></h3>

<p>After almost two years of silence they released a new episode … it does not top <a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/post/2-0-2-pressure">my favorite episode</a>, but it’s well done.</p>



<h3 id="the-operator-in-c"><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7825055/what-does-the-c-operator-do">The ??!??! operator in C</a></h3>

<p>No joke: <code>??!??!</code> is a valid operator in the C programming language … </p>
