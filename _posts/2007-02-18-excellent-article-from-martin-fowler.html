<p>There&nbsp;is a lot of good content up at&nbsp;<cite cite="http://martinfowler.com/articles.html"><a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles.html">Martin Fowler: Articles</a></cite>. (I definitely have to improve my reading speed &hellip;)</p>
<p>Today I read the Article about <a href="http://martinfowler.com/apsupp/appfacades.pdf">Application Facades</a>. This is an excellent article! </p>
<p>The main goal of the article is to provide an example how to present a domain model&nbsp;in a GUI. Fowler uses an Application Facade to expose the domain model. The application facade then also defines a clear interface to test the business logic.</p>
<p>The article seems to be quite old. Fowler mentions problems with Café&rsquo;s debugger (I vaguely remember something called Café, but I think I was playing SimCity&nbsp;in monochrome mode&nbsp;at that time&hellip;). Also Unit-Testing-Frameworks seemed not to exist at the time the article was written, since Fowler&nbsp;shows how to create&nbsp;a crude Framework by hand.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the article is very interesting and the Application Facade is a Pattern that can be used in modern business applications.</p>
<p>But the main value of the article is not the explanation of the pattern nor the code examples. What makes this article a real <em>must read </em>is how Fowler shows the process of developing a domain model. It is a real pleasure to see how the model is evolving in several iterations, and how OO-Techniques&nbsp;are applied to make the model more elegant. Fowler also shows the typical TDD-cycles of implementing-testing-extending-testing-refactoring&hellip; and it really makes sense!</p>
<p>I can really recommend this article for anybody who wants to see a beautiful example of DDD and applying OO-Techniques to a domain model.</p>
