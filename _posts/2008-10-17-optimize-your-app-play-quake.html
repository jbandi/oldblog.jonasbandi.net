<blockquote style="font-size: 14px;">
The quake optimization rule:
<br />
Your boss comes to you because your code is running too slow. You take a week to look at the code. Then you go back to your boss an say, that it takes you about 18 month to get a performance improvement by factor two.
<br />
Your boss then says, well thats all right.
<br />
You go back to your cube and play Quake for 18 month and wait for the next generation of Intel processors.</blockquote>

That is an interesting application of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moores_law">Moors Law</a>. But Ted's point is, that those times are over. Scaling processor power with higher frequencies has reached its limits. 
<br />
Increasing the cores in processors, does not make your existing applications faster for free. Entirely new programming concepts have to be applied to make use of the additional power.
<br />
Functional languages can be helpful in implementing those concepts.
