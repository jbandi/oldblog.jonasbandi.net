Feature Branching is<strong> not recommended for dedicated teams with tight collaboration</strong>, which is the type of collaboration you are striving for in a typical Scrum project.</p><p><br /><strong>Update 2011-08-14:</strong></p><p>Interesting points from the above interview are:</p><ul><li>The pain from merging increases exponentially with the age of your branch.</li><li>In practice feature branches discourages refactoring: You are not improving the core codebase when working on a new feature, because you are afraid of merging those core refactorings back later. You rather build your feature around the existing core, as it is, living with its shortcomings...</li><li>Alternatives are <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html">feature toggles</a> and <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BranchByAbstraction.html">branch by abstraction</a> (archtiectural branching)</li><li>Using feature branches for organizational control is a sign of a dysfuntional environment. If you don't trust your team to commit frequently, then you have a problem that can't be solved with a version control system.</li></ul><p>Related is the article by Martin Fowler describing <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticConflict.html">Semantic Conflicts</a>. The main conclusion there is that tools only can support in merging <em>textual conflicts </em>but they can never solve <em>semantic conflicts</em>.</p><div style="align: right; font-size: 10px; clear: right;"></div><div style="align: right; font-size: 10px; clear: right;"><br /><p><a href="http://twitter.com/jbandi"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; border: none;" src="http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=twitter.com" border="0" alt="http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=twitter.com" height="13px" align="left" /> If you like this, follow me on twitter...</a></p></div>
