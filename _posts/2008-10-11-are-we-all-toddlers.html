<a href="http://apache.org/">Apache Foundation</a> was founded in June 1999.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> was announced in November 2001.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> was registered on SourceForge in November 2001.

Those are all indispensable cornerstones of my current professional life. At the time those cornerstones were built, I was finishing my studies at university. 
<br/>
This means during most of the time in which I was being prepared for my future professional life, the stage in which this professional life should take place was not even nearly defined!
<br/>
<br/>
This is like being a physics student in 1687, at the time when Isaac Newton published his Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica...

You could argue, that it's only the tools that are moving so fast in our industry, the concepts are remaining the same. But I dont't think that is true. We are still in a phase where the concepts are constantly developed and evolved. They have to, for being able to satisfy the ever growing expectations and requirements:

Programming today is not the same as 10 years ago! Most of us have been thought that computer science is about mathematics. We had been learning about algorithm and data structures etc...
<br/>
Most of this is not really relevant today any more!
<br/>

<div style="font-size: 10px">[Discaimer: maybe my perception is a bit distorted from suffeing too long in the trenches of enterprise development, but I think nobody can generally deny the change]</div>
<br/>
<br/>
Compare this to the following statement from <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years</a>:
<br/>
<blockquote x">Researchers (<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/034531509X/">Bloom
(1985)</a>, <a href="#bh">Bryan &amp; Harter (1899)</a>, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805803092">Hayes
(1989)</a>, <a href="#sc">Simmon &amp; Chase (1973)</a>) have shown it takes about ten years to develop expertise in any of a wide variety of areas, including chess playing, music composition, telegraph operation, painting, piano playing, swimming, tennis, and research in neuropsychology and topology. There appear to be no real shortcuts.</blockquote>

What does this mean for our industry? Are we all still toddlers, playing inside our little baby-fences?
