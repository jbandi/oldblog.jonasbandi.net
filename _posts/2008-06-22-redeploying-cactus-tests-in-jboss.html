I am experimenting with <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/">Cactus</a> in JBoss AS.
<br/>
(I am using Cactus 1.8.0 and JBoss 4.2.2.GA)
<br/>
<br/>

According to the Cactus <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/integration/howto_tomcat.html">documentation</a>, there are two ways to deploy your cactus tests:
<br/>
<list>
<li>
Deploy the cactus jars globaly in your application server and deploy your derived <em>ServletTestCase</em>-Tests with your application.
</li>
<li>
Deploy the cactus jars together with your application.
</li>
</list>
<br/>

(this documentation refers to tomcat deployment ...)
<br/>
<br/>

I tried to go with the first method, but it didn't work:
<br/>
After the first deployment everything ran fine, triggering the <em>ServletTestRunner</em> resulted in a nice report showing the test results.
<br/>
But then I changed my tests, redeployed the application and hit the <em>ServletTestRunner</em> again... but nothing changed. The resulting report was still showing the results of the previous deployment.
<br/>
<br/>

When I restarted JBoss, the actual report was shown. But redeploying the app did not update the report.
<br/><br/>

So I changed to method two from above and removed the cactus jars from the global JBoss libraries and packaged them into my app (that's what the cactify-ant-task is for anyway).
<br/>
After that everything was fine. Redeploying the app resulted in a up-to-date report when hitting the <em>ServletTestRunner</em>.
<br/>
<br/>
My guess is, that the result of the <em>ServletTestRunner</em> is cached if this servlet is deployed globally...?
<br/>
<br/>

Probably there is another way to solve the problem while having the cactus jars deployed globally, but the solution works for my needs...
<br/>

The only resource I found on the net was <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/cactus-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg02811.html">this</a>.
