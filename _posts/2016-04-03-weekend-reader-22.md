### [Bash & Linux on Windows](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/30/11331014/microsoft-windows-linux-ubuntu-bash)

This makes Windows much more attractive for many development scenarios. It's just a pitty that not many corporate environments have yet switched to Windows 10.

2016 will finally become the year of Linux on the desktop :-)


### [Xamarin for Everyone](https://blog.xamarin.com/xamarin-for-all)

>.NET is now open source and native on every single device, from mobile to desktop to cloud. 


Ah, did I already mention it? Microsoft is changing ...

### [What We Actually Know About Software Development, and Why We Believe It’s True](https://vimeo.com/9270320)

This is a great talk about the maturity and un-scientific nature of the programming industry.

> All the work that has been done on software estimation to date is pretty much pointless.

> Code review is the best technique known for fixing bugs. Don't write more unit-tests, go read somebody else's code.

### [What does it mean for a software engineer to be at a "senior level"?](https://www.quora.com/What-does-this-mean-for-a-software-engineer-You-are-not-at-a-senior-level/answer/Tom-Wesley-3?srid=33NW&share=0ceef08d)

It's one of those narcissistic Quora questions/answers ... but I like the list of qualities that define a good developer.



### [Large companies and fast cars](http://allankelly.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/large-companies-and-fast-cars.html)

### JavaScript is conquering the World: [A List of Emulators written in JavaScript](https://github.com/fcambus/jsemu)

Crazy how much time some people have to realise such toy projects ...
