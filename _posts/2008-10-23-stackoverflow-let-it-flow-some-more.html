I am pretty late in <a href="http://www.google.ch/search?q=stackoverflow+review&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a">joining the choir</a>, but I think <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a> is an amazing site. 
<br/>
<br/>
This is the very definition of Web 2.0. Just try it: ask a question and be amazed ...
<br/>
<br/>
The brains behind the site are the heavyweights <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel "on Software" Spolsky</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog">Jeff "Coding Horror" Atwood</a>.

<br/>
<br/>
There are two interesting podcasts with Jeff Atwood, discussing the creation of the site: <a href="http://herdingcode.com/?p=36">Herding Code #14</a> and <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=152">Hanselminutes #134</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
The podcasts reveal some particular interesting facts about the technical realization [<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/09/what-was-stack-overflow-built-with/">see also here</a>]:
<list>
<li>
The site is based on the Microsoft <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/">ASP.NET MVC framework</a>, which is still beta!
</li>
<li>
The DBMS is SQL Server 2005
</li>
<li>
The whole site is running on one server: two quad-core CPUs with 4GB RAM
</li>
<li>
Web-Server and Database take about the same load
</li>
<li>
The DB-schema consists of about 16 tables
</li>
</list>
<br/>
Basing a heavy-traffic application on beta-technology, thats probably what they call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming#Courage">extreme courage</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
The server seems quite a lightweight! I have seen enterprise applications with a lot less load that supposedly needed much more horsepower...
<br/>
<br/>
I would have expected more tables in the schema... but maybe they were talking only about the dynamic part of the data...
