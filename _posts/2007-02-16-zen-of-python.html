<p class="citation"><cite cite="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/6913.aspx">Beautiful is better than ugly.<br />Explicit is better than implicit.<br />Simple is better than complex.<br />Complex is better than complicated.<br />Flat is better than nested.<br />Sparse is better than dense.<br />Readability counts.<br />Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br />Although practicality beats purity.<br />Errors should never pass silently.<br />Unless explicitly silenced.<br />In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br />There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br />Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br />Now is better than never.<br />Although never is often better than *right* now.<br />If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br />If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br />Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</cite></p>
