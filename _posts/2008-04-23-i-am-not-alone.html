I blogged about me <a href="http://closed-loop.blogspot.com/2007/06/heading-for-madness-part-1-paranoia.html">heading for madness</a> and my <a href="http://closed-loop.blogspot.com/2008/04/invented-elsewhere-syndrome.html">invented elsewhere syndrome</a>.<br/>
But today I discovered that I am not alone! There are people out there, that are suffering with me... maybe we could form a <a href="http://closed-loop.blogspot.com/2007/08/resharper-to-next-level.html">support group</a> and share ourselves?
<br/>
<br/>
I felt completely understood when I was reading the first chapter of <a href="http://manning.com/dallen/">Seam in Action</a> and came across this:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote>
Just when you've made a decision, a new framework arrives on the scene promising to bury its predecessors. <br/>

These choices can be harmful, especially to productivity. Barry Schwartz argues in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice">The Paradox of Choice</a> that having a bewildering array of options floods our already exhausted brains. The result is 
that your ability to write a quality application stalls. You keep believing that the best framework is the one you haven't tried yet. As a consequence, you spend more time researching frameworks than you 
do designing functional applications. The search consumes you. You develop a false sense of how 
busy you are. While you may appear busy, the fact is, you aren't accomplishing much.
