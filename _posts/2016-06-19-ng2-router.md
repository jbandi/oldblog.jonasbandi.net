For my upcoming Angular 2 Workshop at the [DigiComp DevDays](https://www.digicomp.ch/events/softwareentwicklung-events/devday-zuerich-2016) I did some research about the sad history of routing in Angular:

|Date         | Event              |
|-------------|--------------------|
|April 2014   | The **New Router** prototype for Angular 1.4 & Angular 2 was [created](https://github.com/angular/router/blob/15c4564549b95e50e6775c93fc0b760276a563e6/README.md) (github)  |
|December 2014| [Angular 1.4 was announced containing](http://angularjs.blogspot.ch/2014/12/planning-angular-14.html) the **New Router**|
|May 2015| [Angular 1.4 released](http://angularjs.blogspot.ch/2015/05/angular-140-jaracimrman-existence.html) without **New Router** / **New Router** rebranded to **Component Router** and postponed to Angular 1.5. There are already [tutorials](https://angular.github.io/router/getting-started) for the New Router floating on the internet. |
|June 2015|The **New Router** repository is [deprecated](https://github.com/angular/router/blob/d6e4c4d6de006af1420fe5884c742f17a966d26c/README.md). Sources are merged into Angular 2.|
|2015| Beta versions of Angular 2 are released with the **Component Router** |
|February 2016| Angular 1.5 is [released](http://angularjs.blogspot.ch/2016/02/angular-150-ennoblement-facilitation.html) but the **Component Router** is not part of it|
|March 2016|Component Router for Angular 1.5 is [released](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/6a336ba6a0db29da0bee0a2ecf44857780ec682b/docs/content/guide/component-router.ngdoc) (official docs)|
|May 2016|The **Component Router** for Angular 2 is [deprecated](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/883e0c48b162a93e3843e39803205b8df1fe4860/CHANGELOG.md). The Release Candidate of Amgular 2 contains a new **Router 2.0** with major API changes/breaks  |
|June 2016| The **Router 2.0** is deprecated, **Router 3.0** is [announced](http://angularjs.blogspot.ch/2016/06/improvements-coming-for-routing-in.html) (major API changes)|
|June 2016| Angular 2 RC2 released, still with **Router 2.0** |
|June 2016| **Component Router** for Angular 1.5 is [deprecated](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/86aff733fc07b2b0053957c87c084211a203e94e) (official docs) |


This is not meant as a critique for the Angular team. Their goal is to create a great framework and fortunately they are not afraid to do major rework if they think it improves the final product.

But the above chronology shows the state of current open-source/release-ear-y-and-often based development models. According to the angular team ["Developers all over the world are building production Angular applications today with RC1."](http://angularjs.blogspot.ch/2016/06/rc2-now-available.html).

Of course it was their choice to use a framework that was not yet released as version 1.0.
But I would argue, that most developers were not expecting such major deprecations at least after the release candidate.

Even more projects are based on AngularJS and I bet some of them started migrating to the **Component Router** once it was officially released. I think it's not clear how they should deal with the situation now ...
