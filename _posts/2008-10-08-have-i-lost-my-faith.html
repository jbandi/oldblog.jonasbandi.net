Recently I was listening to the <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2008-05/episode-95-new-guardiancouk-website-matt-wall-and-erik-doernenburg">excellent episode</a> of <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/">Software Engineering Radio</a> about the new <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">Guardian.co.uk</a> website.
<br/>
<br/>

I was eagerly sucking up the facts the two architects Matthew Wall and Erik Doernenburg are presenting in the podcast.
<br/>
But after about 20 min I was shuddering: At this point Matthew and Erik are talking about applying <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/">Domain Driven Design (DDD)</a>, specifically about enforcing <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/discussion/messageboardarchive/Aggregates.html">aggregate</a> rules, when the host (Markus Völter) was stating the following:
<br/>


<blockquote >If I had done that, I probably would have defined a domain specific language, for example a textual DSL, that would know about those concepts. Then you could actually write programs using those common language terms as first class citizens. </blockquote>
<br/>
This made me cringe. I know the Markus Völter is an expert in MDSD and DSLs, but stating the above quote in such a casual manner rings a lot of my alarm bells.
<br/>
<br/>

I just have a bad gut feeling if someone wants to build such essential infrastructure up front. That's when my <a href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2008/04/invented-elsewhere-syndrome.html">invented-elsewhere-syndrome</a> kicks in. 
<p style="font-size:10px">
[<a href="http://c2.com/xp/YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YAGNI</a>, <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch06_Race_to_Running_Software.php">Race to Running Software</a>, <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch03_Less_Mass.php">Less Mass</a> are other things that come to mind ...]

<br/>
I have just seen too many projects, that invented their very own framework.
<br/>
In the beginning everything goes smooth and it is very cool to work on <em>TheFramework(tm)</em> and not having to solve the real business problem. You can really feel smart ... But then the 80-20 rule kicks in and all the special cases threaten to turn <em>TheFramework(tm)</em> into <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/">a big ball of mud</a>.
<br/>
And that's even before maintenance becomes an issue of its own ... who is going to hatch <em>TheFramework(tm)</em> when the underlying technology evolves?
<br/>
<br/>
I think that endeavors like this should not be taken light-headed. This can cause a lot of suffering.
<br/>
<br/>
As my self-confidence as developer is growing, I think I would refuse to work on a project with this premise.
<br/>
<br/>
I think it is exactly the point of domain driven design that it is <strong>not about technology but about concepts</strong>. People too often rush head first into technical realizations. Thats also what Eric Evans says when he mentions that the <a href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2007/02/creativity-and-competent-people.html">competent developers often are not invoved in "domain crunching"</a>.
<br/>

On the other hand, some years ago I would not have been so hesitant and precautious. As a highly motivated graduate, I would myself have rushed headfirst into the challange, working on a cool <em>TheFramework(tm)</em> of my own ... So one could ask: <strong>Why did I loose my faith?</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly I don't know... could it be that I lost my courage in the trenches of enterprise-developement?
