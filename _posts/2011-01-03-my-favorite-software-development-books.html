<div style="width: 410px;">Last year I read a lot of software development books. Among them were many upcoming Manning titles for which I regularly do reviews. <br /><br /> These are my favorite software development books of 2010: <br /><br /><div><iframe src="http://rcm-de.amazon.de/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;nou=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=cl00-21&amp;o=3&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;md=1M6ABJKN5YT3337HVA02&amp;asins=0321503627" style="width: 120px; height: 240px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><strong>Growing Object Oriented Software Guided by Tests</strong><br /><br /> This book is a great resource for learning and getting insights into Test Driven Development. Actually the best resource I have found so far... <br /><br /> The book has influenced my approach to developing software. Although it is certainly difficult to implement the object-oriented design style and the interaction-based testing style that is the core of the book. <br /><br /> The best thing about the book is the non-trivial application that is developed throughout the biggest part of the book. This shows the applicability of the concepts in the "real-world". But be warned: to follow it through, it demands quite a high concentration span from the reader.</div><div style="clear: left; margin-top: 10px;"><br /><br /><iframe src="http://rcm-de.amazon.de/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=cl00-21&amp;o=3&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;md=1M6ABJKN5YT3337HVA02&amp;asins=193518248X" style="width: 120px; height: 240px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><strong>Azure in Action</strong><br /><br /> This is the best "cloud-book" I have read so far (see <a href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2010/11/book-review-azure-in-action.html">my review</a>). <br /><br /> Although this book focuses on the Windows Azure cloud platform. It is a good read for anybody who wants to get in touch with development for the cloud and the underlying concepts.</div><div style="clear: right;"><br /><iframe src="http://rcm-de.amazon.de/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=cl00-21&amp;o=3&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;md=1M6ABJKN5YT3337HVA02&amp;asins=1935182323" style="width: 120px; height: 240px; float: left; padding-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></div><strong>jQuery in Action</strong><br /><br /> This is a great read to learn jQuery. And if you are not familiar with client-side web development this is also a very good way to get started and get familiar with JavaScript, CSS, HTML, DOM-manipulation ... <br /><br /> The great thing about that book is, that the knowhow you get is agnostic of the "classic" development platforms. Regardless if you are doing web development in Java, .NET or Ruby, in the future you will not get around client-side browser programming. <br /><div style="clear: left;"><br/><iframe src="http://rcm-de.amazon.de/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=cl00-21&amp;o=3&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;md=1M6ABJKN5YT3337HVA02&amp;asins=0321601912" style="width: 120px; height: 240px; float: right; padding-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><p><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong><br /><br /> I have not read the whole book yet. But so far this is an essential book that shows the necessary infrastructure and concepts to realize an agile software development workflow. <br /><br /> It is not about the "soft factors" of agile development. There are enough books about XP, Scrum, Kanban, Lean etc. out there ... it is also not so much about the theoretical concepts of the process (it more or less takes iterative and incremental process as given). <br /> Instead the book focuses on techniques and infrastructure that is the base to efficiently realize the concepts of agile development from coding to delivery. <br /> It shows that agile software delivery encompasses much more than using a taskboard, practicing TDD and having a continuous integration build.</p></div><div style="clear: right;"><br /><iframe src="http://rcm-de.amazon.de/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=cl00-21&amp;o=3&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;md=1M6ABJKN5YT3337HVA02&amp;asins=1617290084" style="width: 120px; height: 240px; float: left; padding-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><strong>Specification by Example</strong><br /><br /> This book describes experiences and insights of over 50 "real-world" projects that are trying to implement Behavior Driven Development, Agile Acceptance Testing and Specification by Example. <br /><br /> This book is for testers, business analysts, developers and project managers working on Agile and Lean projects or teams moving to an Agile development method. In (agile) software development success depends heavily on the involvement and collaboration of all stakeholders. The book shows techniques how to realize this collaboration and involvement throughout the whole development process and how to establish the "agile mindset" in the whole team.</div><div style="clear: left;"><br /><br /><iframe src="http://rcm-de.amazon.de/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=cl00-21&amp;o=3&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;md=1M6ABJKN5YT3337HVA02&amp;asins=0321534468" style="width: 120px; height: 240px; float: right; padding-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><strong>Agile Testing</strong><br /><br /> Although this book is not really from 2010, it is one of the books that I finished reading and which keeps influencing my approach to developing software. <br /><br /> The book looks at agile software development from a testers perspective. It breaks with a lot common practices in traditional software testing. One of the central points of the books is, that testing can and should be more than a simple "go/no-go" decision at the end of the development phase. <br /><br />The book describes how to evolve testing into a continuous effort throughout the whole development process. How testing can play a crucial role in requirements gathering, how it can be a supporting tool during development and how it can enable transparency and measure progress. <br />With the advice from the book testers become an essential factor also during development and developers and testers start working together in a highly collaborative way.</div></div><p>Â </p><p>What are your favorite development books of 2010?</p><div style="align: right; font-size: 10px; clear: right;"><br /><p><a href="http://twitter.com/jbandi"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; border: none;" src="http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=twitter.com" border="0" alt="http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=twitter.com" height="13px" align="left" /> follow me on twitter, I need some friends :-)</a></p></div>
