The interface is really neat ... yet another trendy rails app? 
<br/>
<a href="http://www.scribd.com/ipaper">iPaper</a> is also slick at first glance... but do you really want to read documents in your browser?

But then again, is it really more than just riding the Web 2.0 hype? Time will tell ... and I am grabbing the interesting documents while they are still available :-)
