The thing is, early in my career I did Fortran... whether you call them services or procedures, it's the same thing!

Been there, done that! I don't really feel the need to go back to passing a bunch of dumb parameter data into a procedure that we now call a service.

<a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=123">Episode 105</a> of <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/">Hanselminutes</a> "<em>Rocky Lhotka on Data Access Mania, LINQ and CSLA.NET</em>" is very interesting.
<br/>
<br/>

Some observations from my part:
<br/>
<br/>

<list>

<li>
Even experts like Scott Hanselman and Rocky Lhotka have not a consistent idea of Model-View-Controller (MVC). 
</li>
<li>
The old topic of moving data from the database through the businesslayer into the view is a never-ending story. Also Scott and Rocky can give their five cent but no general solution. (Do you pass your business-objects to the view or do you transform them? Are entities business-objects?...)</li>

<li>
I am amazed of how ignorant people are of <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/">Domain Driven Design</a> and smart domain models. Scott seems to imply, that smart business objects are good for small systems, but don't work for big SOA-Systems... 
</li>
<li>
Rocky talks about <strong>Responsibility Driven Design</strong>. Probably he refers to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-Responsibility-Collaboration_card">Class-Responsibility-Collaboration technique</a>. As this technique encourages real OO-Designs, he seems to pursue the same goals as <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/">Domain Driven Design</a>... </li>
