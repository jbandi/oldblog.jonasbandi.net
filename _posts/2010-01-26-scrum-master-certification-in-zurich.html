<br/>
<br/>
If you are thinking about getting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29">Scrum Master Certification</a>, I can fully recommend Mitch's course. 
<br/>
I did attend his course in Vienna last autumn. Those two days were very interesting, informative and never boring. Mitch really is a great teacher and story teller with a lot of practical experience.
