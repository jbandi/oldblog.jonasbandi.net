It is true to any programming methodology, technique or tool.</p><p>﻿﻿In my opinion this perfectly highlights what the real problems are in most software projects today (at least in my 10 years experience as a developer/contractor). But usually those are not the problems teams are trying to solve.</p><p> </p><div class="post-text"><blockquote><p>There are a number of things it can't solve:</p><ol><li>Can't address poor or incomplete requirements.</li><li>Can't work as a silver bullet for unrealistic project deadlines.</li><li>Can't fix poor architecture choices.</li><li>Can't guarantee a robust development environment, it's only a technique.</li><li>Won't solve writers/coders block.  You'll get stuck on what test to write next.</li><li>Doesn't fix a poor understanding of the problem domain.  It will,  however, show that the person doesn't know what to test to someone who  is knowledgeable.</li><li>Won't show you the answer to what algorithm is the "best" to use.</li><li>Isn't a guarantee that you can push to production from development.   It has to go to test unless you're willing to accept the possibility of  bugs.</li></ol><p>That's all I can think of.  About the only way around the things that  TDD doesn't address is to <strong>have a competent, team-oriented group who  want to make good software</strong> rather than clocking in/out from 9 to 5.</p></blockquote><div style="align: right; font-size: 10px; clear: right;"><p><a href="http://twitter.com/jbandi"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;" src="http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=twitter.com" border="0" alt="http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=twitter.com" height="13px" align="left" /> follow me on twitter, I need some friends :-)</a></p></div></div>
