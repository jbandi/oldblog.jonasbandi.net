Programming has become too complex. I suspect that we have lost it for good! 
<br/>
<br/>
Here is another evidence:
<br/>
<br/>
Look at <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001166.html">this blog post</a> by Jeff Atwood about database deadlocks and look at the comments.
<br/>
<br/>
The density of contradictions in the comments is just frightening!
<br/>
<br/>
Considering that the commenters are probably the upper class of developers out there, it seems a miracle that there are actually working transactional systems out there...
<br/>
<br/>
I am not considering me any better at all, a lot of the things the commenters are talking about seems like black magic to me. But I feel terrified by that fact ... thats the basics man! If we don't know how transactions work, how can we start building business applications?
