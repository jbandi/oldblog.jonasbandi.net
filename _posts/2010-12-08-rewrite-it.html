<blockquote style="font-size: 14px;">For a lot of projects a throw-away prototype would be the right thing to do... but people are very afraid of throwing away software.</blockquote><p>This idea of throwing away your project can even be taken further than prototypes! <a href="http://tekpub.com/">TekPub</a> has proven that, read it here:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/architecting-tekpub">Architecting TekPub - Moving from ASP.NET MVC to Ruby on Rails</a></li><li><a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/building-things/tekpub-a-six-pack-and-you">Upgrading Tekpub with Rails 3</a></li></ul><p>It seems that <a href="http://tekpub.com/">TekPub</a> has been completely rewritten two times since going into production about a year ago (and several times as spikes before and after going into production).</p><p><img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_X3kaawac_g4/TP_j233XyLI/AAAAAAAAA5Q/zxPBCNtJ2DU/blankslate.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="blankslate.jpg" width="200" height="174" /></p><p>This is the very realization of some interesting concepts:</p><ul><li><a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-testing/keynote-deliberate-discovery-code-like-you-mean-it">Deliberate Discovery</a></li><li><a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Build_Less.php">Build Less</a></li><li><a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch06_Race_to_Running_Software.php">Race to Running Software</a></li><li><a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/prj/ship-it">Ship It</a></li><li><a href="http://37signals.com/rework/">Rework</a></li></ul><p>Â </p><p>Compare that to your <a href="http://www.michaelnygard.com/blog/2009/02/why_do_enterprise_applications.html">corporate legacy enterprise project</a> ... sure it can't be compared, but why? Couldn't a rewrite be more effective than the uncontrolled growth we all observe in legacy applications?</p><p>It would mean that you also have to keep your enterprise applications slick and lean. Why is that so hard in corporate IT?</p><p>The challenges in rewriting legacy enterprise application are probably the missing stakeholders, the missing original goals and the lost knowledge of the current teams. And those rewrites that are attempted often end up in a gigantic technically driven framework monstrosity... probably because that is easier to do than thinking about business value.</p><p>This seems to be an omnipresent pattern and <em>leaves the sour question if corporate IT is really the place you want to be </em>... especially if you compare it to the seemingly challenging and adventurous parallel universe of web startups.</p><div style="align: right; font-size: 10px; clear: right;"><p><a href="http://twitter.com/jbandi"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; border: none;" src="http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=twitter.com" border="0" alt="http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=twitter.com" height="13px" align="left" /> follow me on twitter, I need some friends :-)</a></p></div>
