<p>Wow! Amazon and the Hackers are both continuously scanning public repositories for passwords!  <br>
This story should make you reconsider where you leave your credit card information… things might get out of hand, even if you think that you are just using a free service …</p>

<h3 id="agile-avoiding-the-most-common-pitfall-of-large-scale-agile">Agile: <a href="http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=abe09ce689751513abf6f095f&amp;id=96b4eb0c7d">Avoiding the most common pitfall of large-scale agile</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://gojko.net/">Gojko</a> wrote an interesting article about the current trend of scaling Agile. Unconventional as always, he draws anaglogies with “The Lord of the Rings” and escaping a concentration camp in WWII. <br>
He argues that our industry is obsessed with effort instead of focusing on outcome. <br>
His main explanaition why Agile does not scale in most attempts is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a small scale, effort does boost outcome.[…] On a larger scale, effort no longer directly relates to results.</p>

<h3 id="salary-in-it-an-endless-topic-on-quora">Salary in IT: An endless topic on Quora</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://qr.ae/RHfg0O">What is it like making around <span>$</span>120K ~ $130K in the US in Sunnyvale, California as a software engineer?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://qr.ae/RHfbZ1">What is the salary range of Software Engineers in London?</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Interesting to see different perspectives. Although I have a hard time to take the second answer seriously. In my experience not many enterprises are looking for the mythical “10x engineer” and are willing to pay these extravagant figures …</p>

<p>Stack overflow has also <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-complang">some info about salaries</a>.</p>

<p>If you missed SwissJS last July, the recorded sessions are now available on YouTube. <br>
If you just want to watch one session, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSThM9Aw8ps">“Creating UIs for the WebA Audio API” by Stephen Band</a>. His usage of the browser to create music is impressive and its a refreshing non-enterprisy topic.</p>

<p>Christin Gorman is adressing the problem of over-engineering in typical business applications. This one is more serious than <a href="https://vimeo.com/28885655">previous presentations</a> by her, but she kept her refreshing way to present …</p>
