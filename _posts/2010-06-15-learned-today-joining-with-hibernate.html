Hibernate (and NHibernate) is able to do a lot of <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.3/reference/en/html/queryhql.html#queryhql-joins">different kind of joins</a>. <br />
Unfortunately it can not do outer joins on properties that are not mapped as associations.<br />
<br />
My goal was to get the result of the following SQL-query with an outer join:<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid silver; padding: 2px;">
<code>
</code>
<pre>select e.Name, d.Status, count(*) from event e
left outer join delivery d on e.Id = d.EventId
group by e.Name, d.Status
</pre>
</div>
<br />
I hoped to realize the above query with Hibernate in HQL. Actually you can do joins between entities where no association is mapped:<br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid silver; padding: 2px;">
<code>
</code>
<pre>select new ReportDto(e.Name, d.Status, count(d))
from Delivery d, StatisticalEvent e where d.EventId = e.Id
group by d.EventId, e.Name, d.Status</pre>
</div>
... unfortunately this is an inner join.
<br />
<br />
You can do outer joins with Hibernate:<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid silver; padding: 2px;">
<code>
</code>
<pre>select new ReportDto(e.Name, d.Status, count(d))
from Delivery d right outer join d.Event e
group by e.Name, d.Status</pre>
</div>
... unfortunately you have to have mapped the association between the two entities, since you have to feed a path to the join expression.
