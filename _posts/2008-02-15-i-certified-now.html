I have passed the SCJP Test today.<br/><br/>


I am not too proud of this feat. But I had to learn a bit more than I initially expected ... luckily I also learned some useful things on the way.<br/><br/>


My main critique of this test is, that it does not respect the modern programming environment enough. A lot of the questions focus on intricate language or syntax details (every second question is something like "Does this compile?"). I just don't think this knowledge is that important anymore today in the area of modern IDEs (background compiling, realtime analysis, error highlighting ...).<br/>

Don't get me wrong: I don't claim that tools can make understanding the concepts obsolete, but spotting errors on the language level is just not important any more.
