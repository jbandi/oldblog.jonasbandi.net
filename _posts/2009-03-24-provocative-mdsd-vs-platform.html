<div style="width:60%;">
Two controversial statements about MDSD from the '<a href="http://www.zuehlke.com/index.php?id=196&backPID=140&typeid=1&eventid=111&L=0">ZÃ¼hlke Late Afternoon Talk: Quo vadis software modeling?</a>':

<blockquote style="font-size:14px">If you have a good platform then you don't need a modeling tool.</blockquote>

<blockquote style="font-size:14px">If you have a good modeling tool, your platform becomes irrelevant.</blockquote>
<br/>
</div>
So where lies the truth? Obviously the boundary is flowing ...
<br/>
<br/>
I my opinion '<strong>modeling</strong>' is a very broad concept, so I would not necessary agree that you can trade between modeling and platform. 
<br/>
But when you replace '<strong>modeling</strong>' with '<strong>code generation</strong>' I am pretty convinced, that both quotes apply, and they represent quite opposite approaches to software development.
<br/>
<br/>

As I stated in <a href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2008/11/musing-about-code-generation-mdsd-and.html">Musing about Code Generation, MDSD and DSLs</a>, I think the current trends in enterprise platforms lead to the first statement.
<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion code generation is less and less needed on modern application platforms, and since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Driven_Software_Development">MDSD</a> currently is so tightly coupled with code generation (at least in my experience) I think MDSD in its current manifestation is getting more and more irrelevant.
<br/>
<br/>
I think MDSD should somehow better adjust to the notion that "t<em>he code is the model</em>" and provide additional abstractions (for different intentions) on top of that.
<br/>
I think the current <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a>-movement is an effort in this direction.
<br/>
<a href="http://teamzone.ch/2009/03/11/code-city/">Visualisation</a> would be another promising aspect. 
<br/>
<br/>
I know this is a provocative statement. Many MDSD evangelists are convinced by their approach... but I just have not seen the light until now, that does not mean that I am not open for an epiphany.
<br/>
So please leave a comment...
