The Answer is Screen! For my work-laptop I do need more screen real estate than the 13'' of the MacBook offers. Also the non-glossy and LED backlit (its bright, real bright...) is a plus. </p> <p>Does it mean I abandon Windows? No, I will run Windows in a Virtual Machine (either VMware Fusion or Parallels). I played around with Visual Studio 2008 in Parallels, and I did not experience any problems. There are some benchmarks <a href="http://hammett.castleproject.org/?p=174">here</a>, that confirm this impression.  </p>
