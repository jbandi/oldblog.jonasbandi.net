<a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Fowler</a> as a werewolf is just hilarious:

This is from the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/No-Silver-Bullet-Summary">No Silver Bullet Reloaded Retrospective OOPSLA Panel 2007</a>.
<br/>
<br/>

There are a lot of gems in the quote from this discussion! The sarcastic comments from Fowler alone are worth the read of the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/No-Silver-Bullet-Summary">summary</a>...
<br/>
<br/>
Reading the summary there seems to be a general consensus that there is really <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">no silver bullet</a>.
<br/>
<br/>

But this is also a dangerous consensus. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Meyer">Bertrand Meyer</a> (also in the summary) poses it:
<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote>... many people, especially managers, rejected new ideas of the ‘80s and ‘90s like OOP, because they did not believe the new technology proposed to them would have a serious impact on development ...</blockquote>
<br/>

Using the insight, that there is no silver bullet as an excuse to stop trying to improve is certainly not the way to go!
<br/>
<br/>

I was a student of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Meyer">Bertrand Meyer</a> at university, and he was a critic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">Fred Brooks paper</a>, because he claimed that it was smothering innovation and the desire for improvement.
