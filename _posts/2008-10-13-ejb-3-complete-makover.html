EJB has undergone quite a makeover!
<br/>
<br/>
While EJB 1/2 was considered obese and ugly , EJB 3 now claims to be the complete opposite.
<br/>
<br/>
I find the following observation illustrates the complete makeover:
<br/>
<br/>
EJB 2 was one of the main reasons for the development of the <a href="http://www.springframework.net/">Spring Framework</a>. Spring aimed to provide a developer-friendly alternative to EJB:

<blockquote>I wrote this book for architects and developers who have grown increasingly frustrated with traditional approaches to J2EE design, especially EJB. It shows what you can do right now t implement cleaner, more productive alternatives to EJB and move into the next era of web applications.</blockquote>
<div style="text-align:right">- Rod Johnson (founder of Spring), 2004, 
<br/>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Expert-One-One-Development-without/dp/0764558315">J2EE Development without EJB</a>
</div>
<br/>
During several years Spring was THE lightweight alternative to the heavyweight EJB model.
<br/>
<br/>
Now with EJB 3 this seems to have changed to the exact opposite:

<blockquote>The Spring framework then would be "Just Another EJB Container On Steroids" (JAEC :-)) - it would make, however, the integration between EJB 3 and Spring easier, than even now. This lowers the entry barrier for EJB 3 as well: the migration to pure Spring environment, in case EJB 3 wouldn't be sufficient for functional, or non-functional requirements, should be not that hard.
</blockquote>

<br/>
EJB is now presented as a quick and easy technology, very lightweight but maybe not ready for advanced enterprise scenarios.
<br/>
Spring on the other hand earns more and more critique as beeing overly complex, verbose, xml-heavy [see Bob Lee <a href="http://crazybob.org/2006/01/i-dont-get-spring.html">here</a> and <a href="http://crazybob.org/2006/02/i-was-too-hard-on-spring.html">here</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/SpringComparison">Guice Comparison</a>, <a href="http://lateralprogramming.wordpress.com/2008/04/07/why-use-spring-if-you-have-a-hashmap-at-hand/">another blog</a> ...].
<br/>
<br/>
One of my last projects was a simple web-application. We decided that EJB would be an overkill and went with a straight JSF-and-Hibernate-in-a-single-war-approach.
<br/>
Today I think that leveraging EJB3 would have made the implementation easier and not more complex, especially when implementing <a href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2008/04/need-help-with-your-conversations.html">stateful-conversations</a>.
