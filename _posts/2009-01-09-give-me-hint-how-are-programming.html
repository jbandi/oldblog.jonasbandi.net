From Jay Fields' <a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2009/01/cost-of-net-negative-producing.html">The Cost of Net Negative Producing Programmers</a>:
<blockquote style="font-size:14px">
Java and C# are not silver bullets. The languages are good solutions to a certain class of problems, using them for problems that could be better solved with a different language stagnates the growth of other languages.</blockquote>

Now I am wondering: <strong>Is a general programming language really predestined for certain kind of problems and not suited for other kind of problems?</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
I can see that performance could be an issue. But apart from that, is the problem domain really a relevant aspect for choosing a language?
<br/>
<br/>
I could agree that platforms and frameworks could be targeted a certain problem domains, but I cannot really see if this is true fro languages. I also think reality shows that the same kind of applications can be solved with all kind of languages, and the results are equally valuable.
<br/>
<br/>
I think there are much more important influences for choosing a language than the problem domain. Like experience of the team, available knowhow and infrastructure, reusing investments and creating homogenous environments ...  
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Can anybody explain to me how the problem domain is relevant for choosing a general purpose language? I would be very much interested in examples ...</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSLs</a> offer a whole new perspective on this topic, but we are talking about general purpose languages here ...
<br/>
<br/>
I also agree that there are niche problem domains (like scientific calculations) that could certainly better solved with special languages, but again, we are talking about general purpose languages ...
