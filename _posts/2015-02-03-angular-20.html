<p>When I am teaching my AngularJS workshops, there is usually a question about the future of AngularJS.</p>

<p>The Angular team announced Angular 2.0 at <a href="http://ngeurope.org/">ng-conf Europe</a> . There was quite some buzz after that announcement.</p>

<p>I think most of those reactions were premature. I am pretty sure there will be a sensible migration scenario from Angular 1.x to Angular 2. The Angular team at Google themselves will come up with a migration path as soon as Angular 2 will be better defined. And there is such a big community around Angular, that I am pretty confident that this migration will be pretty well supported and documented.</p>

<p>For current projects, <strong>I therefore recommend to use Angular 1.3</strong>. I would not wait for Angular 2.0, since it’s future is still pretty unclear and it will take a while until it is released. I would not recommend evaluating another framework just because of the announcement of Angular 2. As I said above, I strongly believe that there will be a viable migration path once Angular 2 is released. Also the concepts that build the fundamament of Angular (like databinding, directives, dependency-injection …) are not changing from Angular 1.x to 2. Therefore if a team learns to write Angular apps now with 1.3, this will be a good investment also for Angular 2.</p>

<p>I recommend to listen to <a href="http://devchat.tv/adventures-in-angular/016-aia-ng-1-3-and-2-0-with-brad-green-igor-minar-and-mi-ko-hevery">episode 16 of Adventures in Angular</a> for more information and assurance about the future of Angular and the topic of migration.</p>
