<br/><br/>

The workshop material can be downloaded <a href="http://realityloop.net/presentations.htm">here</a>.

<br/>
<br/>
One thing I did newly include was <a href="https://easygloss.dev.java.net/">EasyGloss</a>: a framework for simplifying unit testing of annotated classes that require injection in order to function.
<br/>
<br/>
Apart from that I did only very few changes compared to last time. This time was the first time where my preparation effort was actually quite low, which made me somehow proud ...
<br/>
<br/>
... but then again, the whole topic is out of fashion as I learned in this interesting presentation: <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/francl-testing-overrated;jsessionid=5C1654248C01CA209E70B7A5BEDE81B2">Testing is overrated</a>. Maybe I should start looking for another topic ...
