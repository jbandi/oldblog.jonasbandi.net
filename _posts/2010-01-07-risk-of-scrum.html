Last month <a href="http://twitter.com/rjocham">Ralph Jocham</a> gave <a href="http://choose.s-i.ch/events/2009-12-08-jocham">a talk</a> about the Risks of Scrum.
<br/>
<br/>
He published the slides on slideshare: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/choose/ralph-jocham-the-risks-of-scrum">Ralph Jocham The Risks Of Scrum</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as I understood it, Ralph identified two Risks with Scrum:
<br/>
<ol>
<li>Not doing it right or not practicing it to the full extent</li>
<li>Neglecting technical excellence and accumulation of technical dept</li>
</ol>

The first one is a bit a platitude in my opinion. Any failure can be blamed on not doing things right... of course with methodologies that consist of several parts, there is a danger of cherry-picking, but I am not sure that this can't work. I think it's also often a cheap excuse to put the blame for a failure on "not doing it right". I mean, who is <em>really</em> doing it right? How many of the successes are <em>doing it right</em>?
<br/>
<br/>
According to Ralph the second risk should be met with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming">XP practices</a> that focus on technical quality.
<br/>
<br/>
But in my opinion there is a much more fundamental danger in scrum:
<br/>

Scrum gives the impression that it is possible to bring "Embracing Change" and "Getting Things Done" under the same umbrella.
<br/>
<br/>
This is dangerous. "Embracing Change" and "Getting Things Done" are two opposing forces. <strong>On a certain level it is inherently not possible to get things done while embracing change.</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
Scrum as an agile methodology is all about embracing change. With the focus on the Done-Stage on the Taskboard and the "Definition of Done", <strong>Scrum claims that those two opposing forces are actually not opposing. This is in most cases an illusion.</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
This is mostly a result of focusing on small stories with immediate business value. Getting these stories done is possible, and Scrum can easily misused as an "excuse" to neglect the big picture.
<br/>
<br/>
Progressing in Scrum means getting stories done. Often the real progress of a finished story in regard of the whole project is not measured...
<br/>
<br/>
A symptom of this antipattern is that certain things get touched and changed again and again by new stories in subsequent sprints...<em> so what was actually done, the story or the real business problem?</em>
<br/>
<br/>
Shortening sprint duration and focussing on smaller user stories can even aggravate this problem ...
