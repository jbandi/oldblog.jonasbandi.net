<br/>
<br/>
I think even if you are actually not using the bits of <a href="http://grails.org/">Grails</a>, Grails can provide valuable insights and fresh perspectives in the turgid maze of Java EE development.
<br/>
<br/>
At the <a href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2009/05/gr8conf-summary.html">gr8conf</a> it was stated, that Groovy and Grails are in the transition from the early adoption phase to mainstream technology.
<br/>
<br/>
Becoming a mainstream technology is a dangerous beast, which can brings dark secrets into the light.
<br/>
<br/>
Grails seems currently to be in a fight with this beast, as some <a href="http://www.nabble.com/grails....-td24007981.html#a24007981">critics has been voiced on the mailing lists</a>. This is nicely summarized in the following post: 
<br/>

<blockquote style="font-size:14px"><a href="http://www.grailsblog.com/archive/show?id=17">Are Bugs in Grails Hurting Adoption? </a></blockquote>
<br/>
I think critics are essential for a product to become mature. It shows that there are actually people out there that care, and that the community is not just a bunch of zealots.
<br/>
The crucial question is now how Grails will deal with the criticism.
