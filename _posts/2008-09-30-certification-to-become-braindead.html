<br/>
<br/>

You are architecting a real-time system with high usage and high volumes of transactions. You need an MVC application with quick presentation times resembling a thin client and will have several pre-populated views that can carry across several pages. The users must be able to quickly navigate between different sections of the system.
<br/>
<br/>
Which three technologies will you need to implement? (Choose three.)
<br/>
<br/>
<list>
<li>
A) MDB
</li>
<li>
B) Swing GUI controls
</li>
<li>
C) JSP
</li>
<li>
D) EJB3 Entities
</li>
<li>
E) Stateless Session Beans
</li>
<li>
F) JCE
</li>
</list>
<br/>
The solution:
<br/>

Options C, D, E are correct. 
<br/>
Option A is incorrect because it is a real-time system, and MDBs are asynchronous. 
<br/>
Option B is incorrect because swing components are notoriously slow. 
<br/>
Option F is incorrect because nothing is mentioned about security requirements.
<br/>
<br/>
"<em>Swing is notoriously slow</em>" as <strong>the</strong> reason to create a web application??? C'mon ... is that the well-grounded professionalism you are expecting from an architect?
