Is there something like the <strong>opposite of the "not invented here syndrome</strong>"? If there is, I think I am suffering from it...
<br/>
<br/>
Each time somebody shows me some code that looks slightly frameworkish, a home-brewn solution that looks toolish or a self-made process-assistance, I start thinking <em>"you should not have to do this ... there must be an existing solution for this ... you must not do this if somebody else  already solved this ..."</em>
<br/><br/>

And I compulsively start investigating and digging on the net looking for existing solutions and trying to understand them ... evaluating different alternatives ... trying to find the optimum ... spending a lot of time and energy, while not doing anything productive.
<br/>
<br/>
I think I have to find a better balance between this "invented elsewhere syndrome" and plain pragmatism!
