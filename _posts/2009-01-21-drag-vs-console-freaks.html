In <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=392">Episode 392 of DotNetRocks</a> Carl and Richard discuss with Ron Jacobs. When they come to <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Oslo.html">M</a>, the modeling language in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/soa/products/oslo.aspx">Oslo Project</a>, they talk about developers that <strong>don't like Drag&Drop-Editing</strong> (Designers, Wizards, complete IDE-Integration, whatsoever ...):
<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote>... some people really like that. They are like: That's great! And then there is a group of people who are like keyboard guys. They hate to take their hands off the keybord and even touch the mouse...</blockquote>

They give the impression, that those kind of developers are stuck in some age long past, likely ignoring reality and completely indulged in their <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/84556/whats-your-favorite-programmer-cartoon#86093">religious debates about vi versus emacs</a> ...  
<br/>
<br/>
That's an attitude I often encounter in marketing-infiltrated management persons.
<br/>
<br/>
They think that they are enlightened because they have seen some shiny click-and-go demo of the newest flavor of <em>The Application-Generator(tm)</em>... and they think that all the developers out there in the trenches of enterprise IT just refuse to see the light, because their convoluted brains cannot grasp that their existence becomes irrelevant since <em>The Application-Generator(tm)</em> would make coding unnecessary ...
<br/>
<br/>
Thats just snotty ... most developers have had experiences with Drag&Drop-Wizard-Whatsoever-Editors, but they have been burned!
<br/>
<br/>
Most of the stuff is just demo-ware! A heavy toolchain focussing on an initial surprise effect.
<br/>
<br/>
But the resulting solutions are just not elegant, not sustainable and not scalable from a development perspective!
<br/>
<br/>

The <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/05/19/Reviewing-the-Entity-Framework-Source-Control-Support.aspx">problem with the Designer</a> in the recent .NET Entity-Framework seems to be a typical example for this ...
<br/>
<br/>

Another thing are tools that only integrate into the IDE and do not offer a standalone (this usually means 'command-line') execution. This is just not scalable from a development perspective, because it prevents automated builds! Not having to touch the mouse is not really a personal issue here!
