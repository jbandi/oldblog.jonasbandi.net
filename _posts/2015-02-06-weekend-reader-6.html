<h3 id="agile-critics">Agile Critics</h3>

<p>The current state of agile is critizised by some more prominent figures: <br>
Martin Fowler: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E3xfR6IBII">Not Just Code Monkeys</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Developers should not just be passive receivers of product backlog items. This is where most Agile transitions fail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br> <br>
Dave Thomas: <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/talks/the-death-of-agile">The Death of Agile</a> <br>
The first ten minutes are hilarious, where Dave is mocking the commercialisation of Scrum in the past and the new trend of selling “Enterprise Agile”.</p>

<h3 id="facebook-announces-react-native">Facebook announces React Native</h3>

<p>With <a href="http://www.reactnative.com/">React Native</a> Facebook invented yet another approach to program mobile applications in JavaScript. They promise to combine the best of native apps and the web. As far as I understood they use native components  of iOS/Android (no HTML, no browser, no WebView), but they wrap them in JavaScript/JSX and use the JavaScript runtime on iOS/Android to orchestrate the application including the rendering. A very interesting approach … <br>
However they are not chasing the <strong>“pipe dream of write once - run everywhere”</strong>. You will write apps dedicated for iOS or Android, however the programming environment will be the same. They call it <strong>“learn once, write anywhere”</strong>.</p>

<p>On a side note, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVZ-P-ZI6W4">React Native presentation</a> comes with a strong statement in favour of native app development and against web/hybrid mobile apps. </p>



<h3 id="yet-another-javascript-framework-with-big-ambitions">Yet Another JavaScript Framework with big Ambitions</h3>

<p><a href="http://aurelia.io/index.html"><img class="jb-main-img" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HpUktrXaTLg/VNUtJgHJPJI/AAAAAAAACFQ/QUBboQrekyE/s185/main-logo.png"></a> <br>
<a href="http://aurelia.io/index.html">Aurelia</a> is a next generation JavaScript client framework, created by <a href="http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/">Rob Eisenberg</a>, the creator of Durandal. Rob was for a short time part of the Angular team, but he changed his mind and <a href="http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/leaving-angular/">decided to go his own way</a> … the result is a modern framework that builds on ES6 and WebComponents. Sounds interesting, but sceptics might say: <br>

<h3 id="the-javascript-ecosystem-is-broken">The JavaScript ecosystem is broken</h3>

<p>In the interesting article <a href="http://manuel.bernhardt.io/2014/12/30/generation-javascript/">Generation Javascript</a> the desolate state of the JavaScript ecosystem is revealed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not every week-end project should be made public and available through Bower. The Javascript community needs to learn to filter itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="client-side-templating-good-or-bad">Client Side Templating: Good or Bad?</h3>

<p>There has been some recent discussion about client side templating (like it is done by most modern JavaScript frameworks like Angular, Ember and also React):</p>

<p>The challenge was  <br>
- <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/01/the_problem_wit.html">The problem with Angular</a>  <br>
- <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/01/angular_and_tem.html">Angular and templating</a></p>

<p>It reminded me of a debate from some years ago:  <br>
- <a href="http://tomdale.net/2013/09/progressive-enhancement-is-dead/">Progressive Enhancement is Dead</a> <br>
- <a href="http://thatemil.com/blog/2013/07/02/progressive-enhancement-still-not-dead/">Progressive Enhancement: Still Not Dead</a>,  <br>
- <a href="http://jakearchibald.com/2013/progressive-enhancement-is-faster/">Progressive enhancement is faster</a></p>

<p>This time there was a very interesting reaction:  <br>
- <a href="http://www.onebigfluke.com/2015/01/experimentally-verified-why-client-side.html">Experimentally verified: “Why client-side templating is wrong”</a> .  <br>
I like the conclusion that is backed up by data: <strong>For typical (line of business) web applications the advantages of the client-side rendering approach outweight the disadvantages by far</strong>. For public facing sites, where displaying initial content matters and functionality is only a second aspect, client-side rendering can be slower and optimizations with server-side rendering can be worth the effort.</p>



<h3 id="you-should-start-looking-into-es6">You should start looking into ES6</h3>

<p>ES6 will bring a lot of changes. JavaScript codebases will not look the same once ES6 catches on. Features like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">arrow functions</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/template_strings">template string</a> and especially <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function%2a">generators</a> will change the face of JavaScript substantially.</p>

<p>The following videos give a good introduction to what is coming in ES6.</p>

To get started quickly with using ES6 now, this is a good tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iukBMY4apvI">Javascript in 2015</a></p>

<h3 id="learning-promises">Learning Promises</h3>

<p>Promises in JavaScript are not the easiest concept to grasp. However due to the asynchronous nature of JavaScript  they are a very important concept, that can and should have a major impact on the architecture and structure of JavaScript applications. I learned a lot from the following presentation: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUj-J3oUmOw">Promise-Based Architecture</a></p>
