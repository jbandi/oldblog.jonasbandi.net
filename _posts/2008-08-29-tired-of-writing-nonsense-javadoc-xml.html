I can't make up my mind if writing javadoc (or xml-comments in .NET) is falling in the above category ... but often I have the feeling it is preventing me from getting real.
<br/>
<br/>
Very often it just doesn't generate any additional value. Usually JSF-Backing-Beans are a good example for this: In most cases the comment does add exactly nothing compared to the property name...


<pre class="java:nogutter" name="code" >

/**
* Get the name
* @return name
*/
public String getName(){
...
}
</pre>

People from the <a href="http://store.northshoreshirts.com/deofredet.html">department of redundancy department</a> would be delighted ... the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>-gang just left the building ... 
<br/>

I do not want to dispute that <em>sometimes</em> comments are absolutely necessary. But I don't think that it is a good solution to rigorously require comments on everything, just to catch the few spots that need them... 
<br/>
<br/>
... thats like requiring that everybody wears a helmet at work!
<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless in most projects this is the case... as a consequence the quality of the comments is mostly bad and nobody reads them... 
<br/>
But writing them costs many hours and even can give reason for passing or failing a milestone including the the whole traffic on the escalation-ladder ... bummer!
<br/>
<br/>
At least there are some tools that can outomate this nonsense (even though this results in an excuse for <em>not getting real</em>!):
