<p>Dakota tribal wisdom says that when you discover you are riding a dead horse, the best strategy is to dismount. However, in business we often try other strategies with dead horses, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buying a stronger whip.</li>
<li>Changing riders.</li>
<li>Say things like, &ldquo;This is the way we have always ridden this horse.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Appointing a committee to study the horse.</li>
<li>Arranging to visit other sites to see how they ride dead horses.</li>
<li>Increasing the standards to ride dead horses.</li>
<li>Appointing a tiger team to revive the dead horse.</li>
<li>Creating a training session to increase our riding ability.</li>
<li>Comparing the state of dead horses in todays environment.</li>
<li>Change the requirements declaring that &ldquo;This horse is not dead.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Hire contractors to ride the dead horse.</li>
<li>Harnessing several dead horses together for increased speed.</li>
<li>Declaring that &ldquo;No horse is too dead to beat.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Providing additional funding to increase the horse&rsquo;s performance.</li>
<li>Do a Cost Analysis study to see if contractors can ride it cheaper.</li>
<li>Purchase a product to make dead horses run faster.</li>
<li>Declare the horse is &ldquo;better, faster and cheaper&rdquo; dead.</li>
<li>Form a quality circle to find uses for dead horses.</li>
<li>Revisit the performance requirements for horses.</li>
<li>Say this horse was procured with cost as an independent variable.</li>
<li>Promote the dead horse to a supervisory position.</li></ul>
