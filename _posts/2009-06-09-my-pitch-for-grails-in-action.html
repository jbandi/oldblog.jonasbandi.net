Today my copy of <a href="http://manning.com/gsmith/">Grails in Action</a> arrived.
<br/>
<br/>
I did a review for this book, so <a href="http://manning.com/">Manning</a> was so kind to send me a free copy.
<br/>
Unfortunately the publisher decided not to include the quote I provided, so I will print it here:
<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote style="font-size:14px">This book should be a must read for every Java enterprise developer! Grails shows a   pragmatic lightweight approach to the Java EE platform which is eye-opening and will change your perspective on Java enterprise projects.</blockquote>

<br/>
I really believe that learning <a href="http://www.grails.org/">Grails</a> can provide an interesting new perspective on Java EE development. 
<br/>
But I think there are two common misconceptions about <a href="http://www.grails.org/">Grails</a>:
<br/>
<br/>
<list>
<li>
<a href="http://www.grails.org/">Grails</a> is not about code generation. Even though grails provides possibilities for generating skeleton artifacts, thats just a minor convenience feature. You can use the power of Grails without even using the code-generators even once (As a proof you can watch Graeme Rochers <a href="http://www.springsource.com/node/1408">webinar</a> "Bulding Twitter in 40 minutes").
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.grails.org/">Grails</a> is not reinventing the wheel. Grails builds on top of proven Java frameworks (<a href="http://www.springsource.org/">Spring</a>, <a href="http://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> and <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/sitemesh/">SiteMesh</a> being the most prominent ones, but many more integrations are available). Grails is an abstraction layer over those frameworks and aims to provide a seamless integration of those frameworks to form a homogenous web application stack. By default Grails imposes proven best practices for web development. All this is wrapped with the elegance of the <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> language.
<br/>
But Grails is not a one-way street. It is always possible to fall back to plain Java and therefore leverage the rich ecosystem which exists on the Java platform. JMS, REST, Spring Security, JCaptcha, RSS, OpenId, LADAP, jQuery, Axis2, Compass ... you name it, Grails provides it ...
