In <a href=http://www.infoq.com/presentations/modifiability-fowler/">this presentation</a> Dan North (pioneer of <a href="http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd">BDD</a>) makes an interesting observation:

<blockquote>How do you know when Domain Driven Design succeeded?
<br/><br/>
When you listen to a conversation between two developers, and you can't tell if they are discussing the code or the business problem.

A year ago I would not have thought this as a particular accurate observation. At this time I was working in a project, where we had quite a good <a href="http://www.domaindrivendesign.org/discussion/messageboardarchive/UbiquitousLanguage.html">Ubiquitous Language</a>. 
<br/>
But now I have experience in working in a project, where the developers (including me) often cannot connect their current implementation-steps to the underlying business-reasons. In this project the "implementation-language" is very far away from any business-language. So the above statement seems to bring the value and goal of <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/">Domain Driven Design</a> very much to the point.
