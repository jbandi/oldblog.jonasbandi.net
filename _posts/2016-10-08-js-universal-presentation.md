Last month I was invited to give a talk at the annual developer day of [Swiss Railways (SBB)](http://www.sbb.ch/sbb-konzern.html).

The SBB Developer Day is a full day conference that SBB organizes for their Development staff. The day is organized in several parallel tracks.

This is [the presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/JonasBandi/javascript-the-universal-platform) from my session at the SBB Developer Day: *JavaScript - The Universal Platform?*

The presentation showed an experiment I did: What can I achieve by  using JavaScript exclusively.

I implemented three versions of the same application:

- The web version of the application was using React
- The native mobile application is using React Native
- The desktop application is using Electron

The experiment shows how it is possible to achieve knowhow-reuse and code-reuse by using the JavaScript ecosystem.

The code examples are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/jbandi/birdcage-experiment).
