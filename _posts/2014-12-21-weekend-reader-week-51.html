<h3><a href="http://www.dnug-bern.ch/Events.aspx">Rob Ashton speaks at the .NET user group</a></h3>
<p>I never met Rob, but I think he is a very interesting character in the programming space.</p>
<p>His episode as a “journeyman programmer” is mind blowing and I suggest to every enterprise programmer to have a look at it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puyy8JdbsUQ">"The software journeyman's guide to being homeless and jobless.”</a> (or if you have a plural sight subscription you can watch the production: <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/changeitup">Change it Up</a> where Rob Conery does an extensive interview with Rob).</p>
<p>Rob will be <a href="http://www.dnug-bern.ch/Events.aspx">speaking on January 7th in Bern</a> and on <a href="http://www.dotnet-zentral.ch/2014/12/12/08-01-2015-npm-and-reactjs-with-rob-ashton/">January 8th in Luzern</a> about "Frameworkless development with NPM and React” - a very interesting topic in my opinion. And of course not at all related to .NET programming :-). So I hope to see some non .NET programmers at the event...</p>
<p>While we are at it, here are some further interesting posts of Rob Ashton:</p>
