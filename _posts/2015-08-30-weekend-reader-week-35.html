Instead of trying to compete with native apps by cramming more and more features into browsers, we should focus on the web’s strengths: simplicity, URLs and reach.</p><blockquote>  <p>We get ever more features that become ever more complex and need ever more polyfills and other tools to function — tools that are part of the problem, and not of the solution.</p></blockquote><h3 id="web-dev-a-hex-editor-in-the-browser">Web Dev: <a href="https://hexed.it/">A hex editor in the browser</a></h3><p><a href="https://hexed.it/">https://hexed.it/</a> - Just another instantiation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood">Attwood’s Law</a>:</p><blockquote>  <p>Any application that can be written in JavaScript will eventually be written in JavaScript</p></blockquote><h3 id="work-long-hours-backfire-for-people-and-for-companies">Work: <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/08/the-research-is-clear-long-hours-backfire-for-people-and-for-companies">Long Hours Backfire for People and for Companies</a></h3><blockquote>  <p>In sum, the story of overwork is literally a story of diminishing returns: keep overworking, and you’ll progressively work more stupidly on tasks that are increasingly meaningless.</p></blockquote><h3 id="javascript-angular-2-migration">JavaScript: <a href="http://angularjs.blogspot.ch/2015/08/angular-1-and-angular-2-coexistence.html">Angular 2 Migration</a></h3><p>The supported migration scenario from Angular 1 to Angular 2 will not be based on the Angular <a href="https://github.com/angular/router">New Router</a> (aka. Component Router) any more (it seems as the New Router has been killed as a standalone project anyways). The Angular team <a href="http://angularjs.blogspot.ch/2015/08/angular-1-and-angular-2-coexistence.html">posted a sophisticated plan</a> how migration will look like. It looks interesting, but as far as I gather it’s still only a plan, the bits are not available yet …</p><h3 id="webdev-phoenix-framework-10">WebDev: <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/blog">Phoenix Framework 1.0</a></h3><p>The hype moves on: <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixr</a> seems to get traction. And the <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix Framework</a> is certainly worth having a look at for modern web development …</p><h3 id="online-education-a-lucrative-business">Online Education: <a href="http://blog.pluralsight.com/online-educations-millionaire-teacher">A lucrative business</a></h3><p>Online courses are sprouting out of the internet like mushrooms in autumn … I for myself have currently a subscription to <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralshigt</a> and to <a href="https://egghead.io/">Egghead.io</a>. But there is so much more … <br />
The business seems to be lucrative, at least for some teachers …</p><h3 id="funny-readable-code-and-the-long-lost-secret-of-how-to-achieve-it">Funny: <a href="https://vimeo.com/49484333">Readable code - and the long lost secret of how to achieve it</a></h3><p>(funny and provocative … see the comments) <br />
