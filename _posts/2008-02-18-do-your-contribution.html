Imagine a project where people are changing every two weeks (not figuratively speaking)... 
<br/>
What would you expect of the productivity and quality?
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I am on my first week of the mentioned project. On my first day I have already seen a whole patchwork of involved programming languages: Java, C++, Python, awk, bash, SQL ...
<br/>
<br/>
Did I mention, that the inherent complexity of the project is quite trivial?
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm... I am thinking about doing my contribution in Ruby ;-)
