<a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/javaee5/deployment/#0.0.0.0.Deploying%20Applications|outline">Directory deployment</a> can help you to improve your productivity when developing web-applications with <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/">GlassFish</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of deploying a packaged archive (.war) you can point GlassFish to a directory and <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-4733/ablgw?a=view">let it pick up and deploy</a> the application from there.
<br/>
<br/>
You can do this by using the command <em>asadmin deploydir path_to_app_dir</em>.
<br/>
<br/>
This has the following benefits:
<list>
<li>
You don't have to assemble the archive-package. That's one step less in the build-process.</li>
<li>
Changes to your web-sources (JSPs, facelets...) are picked up immediately. There is no need for redeployment! This can be a huge producivity-boost!</li>
<li>
According to <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-4733/ablgw?a=view">this dcumentation</a>, it should also be possible to dynamically reload the whole application (not only your web-sources)... but for some reason this didn't work for me...</li>
</list>
<br/>
<br/>
The directory you point GlassFish to should have the <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/javaee5/deployment/#0.0.0.0.Packaging%20Applications%20for%20Deployment%7Coutline">following structure</a>:
<br/><br/>

–|myproj<br/>
–|–|web-sources (JSPs, facelets, css ... subdirectories are possible)<br/>
–|–|...<br/>
–|–|–|WEB-INF<br/>
–|–|–|–lib<br/>
–|–|–|–classes<br/>
–|–|–|–web.xml<br/>
–|–|.reload<br/>

<br/>
The trick is to configure your IDE/Environment, so that you can work directly on the above structure...
<br/><br/>

By touching '.reload', you can force the application to be redeployed.
