<br />
Go watch it, it's brilliant ... and while you are at it watch also his even more provoking presentation <a href="http://vimeo.com/43612920">Reinventing Software Quality</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Myth #1: Instoolation</b><br />
Belief that process problems can be solved by installing a tool<br />
<br />
<b>Myth #2: Businessting</b><br />
Belief that business users should write acceptance tests<br />
<br />
<b>Myth #3: Acceptegration</b><br />
Belief that tests are either unit of acceptance-integration<br />
<br />
<b>Myth #4: Rolation</b><br />
&lt;insert role&gt; should do BDD in isolation (eg testers do everything)<br />
<br />
<b>Myth #5: Longression</b><br />
Belief that the long term value of BDD is in regression testing<br />
<br />
<br />
And as completion the <a href="http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Five-Ways-to-Misuse-Fit.html">five ways to misuse FIT by James Shore</a>:<br />
<br />
Misuse #1: Use Fit for Test Automation<br />
Misuse #2: Customer? What Customer?<br />
Misuse #3: Write Integration Tests<br />
Misuse #4: Spin Your Propeller<br />
Misuse #5: Specify Everything <br />
<br />
A conclusion from all this myth-busting is probably that BDD is a concept that is rarely understood and still very much in flux:<br />

BDD starts out as "tests are specs" now it's "full stack methodology" wondering where it will stop!<br />

There's a cargo cult of Cucumbering going on and people need a reminder for when it's a good fit.<br />

If we wait another year, then practicing BDD will be identical to what XP was in 1999<br />
