<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/development-of-asynchronous-network-applications-using-vertx/book"><img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" title="2913OS.png" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-SvdWhvepLhc/UmYIIynbgTI/AAAAAAAABeg/KXWotrQO1Rk/2913OS.png?imgmax=800" alt="2913OS" width="175" height="213" border="0" /></a> Last Year at the SBB Developer Day I was presenting a talk about <a href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2012/12/presentation-vertx-asynchrones-event.html">Vert.x:Â asynchronous event-driven web-applications on the JVM</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://vertx.io/">Vert.x is a very interesting project</a> that brings some fresh concepts to the JVM platform. At first glance <a href="http://vertx.io/">Vert.x</a> looks like a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> clone for the JVM. But there are differences: Vert.x can not (yet) offer the <a href="https://npmjs.org/">gigantic ecosystem of modules of Node.js</a>, but it is certainly attractive for bringing a "Node.js-like" programming model to the proven and scalable JVM platform. With its <a href="http://vertx.io/core_manual_java.html#event-bus">distributed event bus</a> and the concept of <a href="http://vertx.io/manual.html#writing-blocking-code-introducing-worker-verticles">"worker verticles"</a> Vert.x offers concepts that go beyond Node.js.</p>
<p>Packt Publishing sent me the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/development-of-asynchronous-network-applications-using-vertx/book">Book "Instant Vert.x"</a> for review.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/development-of-asynchronous-network-applications-using-vertx/book">Instant Vert.x</a> is a short book (54 pages). As the name suggests, you can read it in "an instant" and it gets you bootstrapped into the world of Vert.x.</p>
<p>I liked the style of the book: it is short and concise and after reading it, you have a good overview over Vert.x as an application platform and the programming model that comes along with Vert.x.</p>
<p>However I have to note that the Vert.x project has a very nice <a href="http://vertx.io/docs.html">online documentation</a>. In my opinion the book goes not beyond the information that is also available online.</p>
<p>The advantage of the book is, that it structures the information in an easily digestible way that you can read in chunks offline. However I would have hoped for more "in-depth" information or some "best practices" how to use Vert.x in real projects.</p>
<p>If you have never heard of <a href="http://vertx.io/">Vert.x</a>, I can fully recommend <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/development-of-asynchronous-network-applications-using-vertx/book">"Instant Vert.x"</a>. If you have already played with Vert.x the book is probably not for you.</p>
