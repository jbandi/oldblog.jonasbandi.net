I have stated several times, that I don't believe in visual modeling and cannot share the enthusiasm that a certain branch of MDSD people have for visual modeling:

Now <a href="http://twitter.com/martinfowler">Martin Fowler</a> is coining the Term <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/IllustrativeProgramming.html">"Illustrative Programming"</a> in the context of Language Workbenches like <a href="http://www.intentsoft.com/technology/overview.html">IntentionalSoftware</a>, which are tools to build "illustrative DSLs".
<br/>
<br/>
For a lot of people coming from the UML camp, the notion of a "DSL" is what Fowler is calling an "illustrative DSL" here.
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126235.aspx">Visual Studio Domain-Specific Language Tools</a> are a striking example of this.
<br/>
<br/>
In his article <a href="http://twitter.com/martinfowler">Martin Fowler</a> quotes some opinions of <a href="http://twitter.com/Neal4d">Neal Ford</a> about the concepts of <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/IllustrativeProgramming.html">Illustrative Programming</a>:
<br/>

<blockquote style="font-size:12px"><list>
<li>
I think these tools work best for lay people (thus, your link to <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/LayProgrammer.html">LayProgrammers</a>). However, in general, tools like this slow down experienced/power users. [...] I would much prefer a markup language I could use to directly define stuff, with macros, snippets, and all the other things I'm accustomed to as a developer.
</li>

<li>
As these tools grow, they get unwieldy (perhaps because they are ceasing to be domain specific enough?).  [...] APIs in programming languages scale much better, with several orders of magnitude more density before they become hard to navigate.
</li>

<li>
All the best-practices and tools don't exist there: refactoring, levels of testing, etc. Also, you loose the connection to text, meaning that macro facilities either don't exist or complex one-offs. [...]
</li>

<li>
I share your bullishness around these types of tools, but they are a long time from being useful for full-bore Agile development. I hope they mature fast.
</li>
</list>

<strong>Reading these comments, I am having a deja-vu!</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
This is really expressing what I was feeling when I was involved in MDSD attempts in recent projects.

I don't generally doubt the noble goals that the visual modeling camp believe in.
<br/>
<br/>

But the tools and environment are just not ready to provide value. At least not in that kind of mainstream real world enterprise projects I have been involved in.
<br/>
<br/>

Also in my experience, the target of <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/IllustrativeProgramming.html">illustrative programming</a> is the developers,<em> which is wrong</em>!
<br/>
<br/>
As Fowler is pointing out, the goal of illustrative programming is to engage <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/LayProgrammer.html">lay-programmers</a>.
<br/>
<strong>Developers need other tools than lay-programmers!</strong> So if there are no lay-programmers in your project, there is arguably need for <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/IllustrativeProgramming.html">illustrative programming</a>... 
<br/>
<br/>
This insight was always lacking when I was confronted with attempts at visual modeling.
<br/>
<br/>
It is a common mistake in a lot of projects to establish some kind of two-class society among the developers, in this case it could be tempting to degrade the second class to lay-programmers. But that is a sick environment to begin with (and the topic for another post)...
