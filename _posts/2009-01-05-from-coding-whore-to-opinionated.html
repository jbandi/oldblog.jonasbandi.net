Have you also been on projects where things were done entirely different to your own opinions. 
<br/>
Maybe they totally contradicted values that are most important for you? But you coped and went along? 
<br/>
Did you feel compromised, even dirty, for not resisting? Did it make you feel like a coding whore?
<br/>
<br/>


<a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a> and Ruby on Rails shaped the concept of <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch04_Make_Opinionated_Software.php">opinionated software</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
As most ideas from <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a>, I like the concept of opinionated software.
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Now I am wondering if the concept of being opinionated could be extended from software to ... the developer?</strong>
<br/>
<br/>

When coming to a new project, take a good look! As a developer you don't have to put up with everything! Evaluate your opinions:

<br/>
<br/>

<list>
<li>
No Source Control? - <em>Where is the exit, please ...</em>
</li>
<li>
No Unit Tests? - <em>Thanks, I am out ...</em>
</li>
<li>
Continuous Integration is a foreign word? - <em>Sayonara from me ...</em>
</li>
<li>
Staging, what is that? - <em>Good bye ...</em>
</li>
<li>
Stakeholders are not readily available? - <em>These boots are made for walking ...</em>
</li>
<li>
...
</li>

</list>
<br/>

Is that being arrogant? 
<br/>
If you have opinions, why should you not commit to them?
