<span style="font-weight:bold;">Update 2009-08-18:</span> I did only get halfway to true enlightenment... Dierk König was so kind to correct me in his comment (see comments bellow). Thanks!

There is advice out there, that it is a good idea to use Groovy for unit-testing your Java code.



The following developerWorks article is a good example for this idea: 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-pg11094/">Practically Groovy: Unit test your Java code faster with Groovy</a>
<br/>
<br/>
There is even the opinion, that writing tests in Groovy can be a good starting point to secretly sneak Groovy into your Java project.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://twitter.com/mittie">Dierk König</a> was giving an interesting talk at <a href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2009/05/gr8conf-summary.html">gr8conf</a> presenting "<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gr8conf/groovy-usage-patterns-by-dierk-knig">Seven Groovy usage patterns for Java developers</a>".
<br/>
<br/>
Using Groovy for unit-testing would best fit the "House Elf"-pattern, along with using Groovy for build automation, deployment and functional tests.
<br/>
<br/>
But Dierk König did not mention unit-testing in his presentation!
<br/>
<br/>
When questioned about that, Dierk König gave an interesting answer: 
<br/>
<br/>
Unit-Tests are ideally realized with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development (TDD)</a>.
But TDD is more about design than about testing, the resulting unit-tests are just a convenient by-product of the process.
<br/>
<br/>
So unit-tests should be a design tool, a mean to drive and evolve the underlying code.
<br/>
Dierk König argued, that ..
<blockquote style="font-size:14px"> ...in order to achieve the goals of TDD, unit-tests should be written in the same language as the underlying code.</blockquote>
<br/>
<br/>
Sounds pretty obvious to me...
<br/>
<br/>
It is clear that this is only valid for true unit-tests. Integration-tests and functional-tests are a completely different story. I think thats the area where more expressive languages like Groovy can shine.
<br/>
<br/>
Thats probably also a reason why the real <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development#Tools">BDD</a> scene seems to prefer Ruby and Groovy...
