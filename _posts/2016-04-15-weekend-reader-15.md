### [Microsoft kills RoboVM](https://robovm.com/robovm-winding-down/)

RoboVM was a cross-compiler that allowed you to develop native mobile applications for iOS and Android in Java and based on the Java ecosystem. Java is typically banned from the iOS ecosystem, since Apple does not allow just-in-time compilation as it is used by the Java virtual machine. RoboVM based applications were allowed in the Apple app store, because it used an ahead-of-time compiler that compiled Java to native code.  

In the Java community it was somehow a show-case to prove that Java was still cool.

In October 2015 RoboVM was acquired by Xamarin. Xamarin basically offers the same approach like RoboVM, except that they use C# as language. In February 2016 Xamarin was acquired by Microsoft. Everybody cheered, since Microsoft released the Xamarin tooling for free.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am wondering about the long term future of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoboVM?src=hash">#RoboVM</a> after the acquisition of <a href="https://twitter.com/xamarinhq">@xamarinhq</a> by Microsoft ...</p>&mdash; Jonas Bandi (@jbandi) <a href="https://twitter.com/jbandi/status/702802337232982017">February 25, 2016</a></blockquote>

However RoboVM turned out to be the collatoral damage of the Xamarin acquisition: Probably Microsoft does not have any interest in keeping Java attractive as a platform. So be it, no cool play-stuff for Java, go back to your dusty servers and stay there along with Cobol and Fortran.


### [RedHat loves .NET](http://redhatloves.net)
Sleeping with the enemy ... but this is the shiny new world. [Microsoft loves Linux](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/2015/05/06/microsoft-loves-linux/), RedHat loves .NET ... the only one who is sitting in the corner without getting any love seems to be Java.  
It will be interesting to see how RedHat will be able to invest into this new romance with .NET without endangering it's old relation Java ...


### [Oracle JET](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/index.html)
Yet another web framework ... this time from a big commercial vendor.  
On the second glance, it is more like a super-framework, aggregating other frameworks: jQuery, jQuery UI, Knockout ...  
Suffering currently from the churn in the React ecosystem, this might actually make sense for the enterprise ecosystem ...


### [Why JavaScript development is crazy](http://www.planningforaliens.com/blog/2016/04/11/why-js-development-is-crazy/)

>The state of Javascript development is overwhelming and confusing because everyone is overengineering their apps by default without even realizing it.

Another rant about the current complexity in the JavaScript ecosystem.


### JavaScript is everywhere:[OSX iMessage Exploit using JavaScript](http://www.bishopfox.com/blog/2016/04/if-you-cant-break-crypto-break-the-client-recovery-of-plaintext-imessage-data/)
Building desktop applications based on web technologies seems the new hotness. Who would have guessed that iMessage on OSX is actually a browser view? But this opens you up for web security problems too ...


### [How We Build Code at Netflix](http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/03/how-we-build-code-at-netflix.html)

>We are always looking to improve the developer experience and are constantly challenging ourselves to do it better, faster, and while making it easier.

You read a lot about Netflix using JavaScript, even on the server. But reading that post, I conclude that Netflix is still mostly Java based. It is an interesting description of a highly sophisticated build pipeline.


### [Your Hybrid App is Going to Kill You](https://medium.com/teach-code/your-hybrid-app-is-going-to-kill-you-416041d27eac#.iu9z7s6fj)
>Hybrid apps are usually chosen because executives are looking for shortcuts. Some marketing genius (sarcasm) planted the seed that hybrid apps are developed quicker and are less expensive by hiring web developers

For myself, I have witnessed a successful hybrid app development just recently... with a very low budget and short timeline ...

Classic paintings with a geeky subtitle. Some are hilarious ...
