<p>This Friday the <a href="http://choose.s-i.ch/events/forum2014">annual Choose Forum</a> will take place in Bern.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://choose.s-i.ch/events/forum2014">Choose Forum</a> is a small and lesser known conference that features highly interesting speakers each year.</p>
<p>I am very honored that I was invited to speak at the Forum this year along with <a href="https://twitter.com/mfeathers">Michael Feathers</a>, <a href="http://erik.doernenburg.com/">Erik Doernenburg</a> and <a href="http://www.adamtornhill.com">Adam Tornhill</a>.</p>
<p>My talk is titled “<strong>There is something about JavaScript</strong>”: </p>
<p><em>This is the tale of an enterprise developer taking the adventurous journey into the realm of JavaScript. We will learn about all the dangerous pitfalls that lured on the way, but also about all the amazing encounters and beautiful discoveries that were waiting in on our protagonist.</em></p>
<p>I am looking forward to the event on Friday.</p>
