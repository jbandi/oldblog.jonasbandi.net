After starting a new job two weeks ago, I try to draw a conclusion of the insights I think I gained during the last year.
<br/>
The following may sound patronising, but it is not intended that way. It is just an attempt of self-reflection, and I am aware, that I could hardly practice what I preach ...<br/>
<br/>

<strong>Process:</strong>

<list>

<li>
Never do anything without a specification.
</li>
<li>
Defining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_%28Specific_Measurable_Achievable_Realistic_Time%29">SMART</a> objectives is most important.
</li>
<li>
Don't be afraid of the 3Cs: Command-Control-Correct! This constant iteration is constructive and imperative to be productive! This has nothing to do with repression or dictatorship. [Actually having a manager that has done some additional military service can be beneficial here ;-)] As a developer it is very important that you know that your work is relevant and somebody cares!
</li>
<li>
Some kind of conceptual modal/ubiquitous language of the business problem is very important. It has to be documented somehow and become common knowledge of all involved team members (including stake holders).
</li>
<li>
Watch out for the danger of retrofitting the conceptual model after an existing implementation ... <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask">Tell don't Ask</a> has meaning on all levels...

</li>
<li>
My understanding of production-ready quality has been utterly overhauled.
</li>
<li>
If you are working in a team, <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SharpenTheSaw">Sharpening the Saw</a> and <a href="http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Gopher-Holes.html">Filling Gopher Holes</a> cannot be a One Man Show.
</li>
<li>
Bringing Testing into a big existing project is very difficult.
</li>
<li>
Producing more code is not necessarily a sign of progress.</li>
</list>
<br/>

<strong>Technology:
</strong><br/>

<list>
<li>
Design for testability IS important.
</li>
<li>
My dislike for code-generation has increased.
</li>
<li>
A layered architecture is just a millstone around your neck if it is not intended for decoupling different concerns.
</li>
<li>
Working with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_database">bitemporal data</a> increases complexity by an order of magnitude.
</li>

<li>
Do not underestimate data migrations!</li>
</list>

<br/>

<strong>Personal:</strong>

<list>
<li>
I want to <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SharpenTheSawForDevelopers.aspx">sharpen my saw</a>.</li>

<li>
I want to work smart, not hard. I want to make a difference. I want to be able to identify with what I am delivering.</li>

<li>
Salary is not the most important aspect of a job. - This is no longer an empty phrase for me.
</li>

<li>
Working in a <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2006/09/21/The-Will-to-be-Good.aspx">good team</a> is bliss - you only can really value that if you have seen both ends of the scale.
</li>
<li>
It is very hard to work in an environment, where the majority of people does not share your mindset concerning important work related topics.</li>

<li>
My trust into the sentence "<em>This should not be a problem.</em>" has asymptotically reached zero.
</li>

<li>
The sentence "<em>I fix it when I see it!</em>" from a member of my management triggers the immediate urge to run to the nearest exit.
</li>
<li>
I want to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-March-2nd-Yourdon-Press/dp/013143635X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1203184348&sr=8-1">Death March</a>.</li>
</list>
