According to the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321534468?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cl02fb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321534468">Agile Testing</a> there is a certain kind of tools  called <b>Agile Web Testing Tools</b>. The book does not contain a precise  definition.<br />
﻿My definition of Agile Web Testing Tools contains the following characteristics:<br />
<ul>
<li>Lightweight (not needing heavy infrastructure or installation nor difficult licences)</li>
<li>Can be run on any developer workstation and can be easily integrated in a continuous build</li>
<li>Programmatic API for web automation</li>
<li>Integrates with common test automtation frameworks (JUnit, NUnit ...)</li>
</ul>

﻿I don't fully agree with the "Agile" prefix, but I guess that is an  attempt to differentiate those tools from heavier multi purpose tools  like Borland SilkTest, HP QuickTest (formerly Mercury) or Visual Studio  Team System Test Edition.<br />
<br />
Following from the characteristic of hose  tools is the fact, that they are rathe<b>r developer focused</b>. They approach  functional web testing from the unit-testing perspective and strive to  be as close to the existing <b>programming artifacts</b> (the tools have a  programming API, tests are written as code, tests should be runnable as  part of the normal build, no special management tools are necessary ...)  <br />
<br />
The current situation around this type of tools is quite  entangled, some tools are extending or complementing others, some are  competitors and new ones are sprouting out of others... <br />
<br />
The following post tries to get some order and structure in the landscape of those Agile Web Testing Tools. <br />
<br />
The first imortant distinction is between <b>out-of-browser (headless browser)</b> and <b>browser automation</b> tools.<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Out-of-browser tools</b> do not run the test against a real browser but use some kind of browser-simulation/emulation. This simulation/emulation can usually be run in-process, embedded inside an automated test.</li>
<li><b>Browser automation</b> tools drive a real browser to access the application under test.</li>
</ul>
<br />
The browser automation tools then can be divided between <b>browser-remoting</b> tools and <b>in-browser</b> tools.<br />
<ul>
<li>A <b>browser remoting</b> test-driver controls the browser from the outside through some programmatic API.</li>
<li>An <b>in-browser </b>test-driver is a test execution runtime that runs inside  the browser (usually as JavaScript). This runtime then accesses the  application under test from within the browser.</li>
</ul>
<br />
Some confusion is currently created  by a third kind of tools. These tools are <b>wrappers</b> or <b>abstractions</b> over concrete test-drivers. They try to give a <b>common programming model  for automated functional web tests.</b> This way the same tests should be  runnable on a headless browser or on a browser automation driver.<br />
<br />
<br />

<b style="font-size: 18px;">Headles browsers:</b><br />
<br />
<a href="http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/" style="font-size: 14px;">HtmlUnit</a> (Java)<br />
HtmlUnit is a  headless browser that runs in in memory and is implemented in Java.  HtmlUnit is the base for a lot of other libraries/tools.<br />
HtmlUnit itself uses Apache HttpClient, a library for from Apache.<br />
HtmlUnit  includes Rhino as JavaScript runtime. Unfortunately Rhino is not used  in any browser, so if you test JavaScript using HtmlUnit the results may  differ significantly from those browsers.<br />
<br />
There are attempts to run a IKVM-ported version of HtmlUnit under .NET:<br />
<ul>
<li>See <a href="http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2010/03/30/using-htmlunit-on-net-for-headless-browser-automation/">this blog post by SteveSanderson</a></li>
<li>There is the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/watin-htmlunit/">watin-html project</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<br />
<a href="http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/" style="font-size: 14px;">HttpUnit</a> (Java)<br />
An alternative to HtmlUnit, but the last release is from 2008. This project seems to be dead.﻿<br />
<br />
<a href="http://github.com/brynary/webrat" style="font-size: 14px;">Webrat</a> (Ruby)<br />
A browser simulation for testing ruby web applications. Primarily used for testing Rails, Merb or Sinatra applications. <br />
Because  Webrat is a browser simulation, it is faster than in-browser testing  solutions. The drawback is, that it does not handle JavaScript at all. <br />
Webrat  also can be configured to run on top of Selenium. In Selenium mode the  tests are run with selenium against a real browser, but the same webrat  API can be used as in the browser simulation mode. <br />
In Selenium mode Webrat takes care of running the java selenium server. <br />
Webrat is wildely used in combination with the Ruby testing libraries Cucumber and RSpec.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://github.com/brynary/rack-test" style="font-size: 14px;">Rack-Test</a> (Ruby)<br />
A library that mocks http-request for Rack applications. Rack-Test is usually used in combination with&nbsp;Ruby web framworks like Rails, Merb or Sinatra.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.jboss.org/jsfunit" style="font-size: 14px;">JSFUnit</a> (Java)<br />
JSFUnit  is a test framework for JSF applications. It is designed to allow  complete integration testing and unit testing of JSF applications using a  simplified API. <br />
JSFUnit tests run inside the container. They have to be packaged and deployed with your application.<br />
JSFUnit is built on top of <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/">Cactus</a> (a java in-container testing framework)<br />
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://watir.com/" style="font-size: 14px;">Watir</a><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span>(including FireWatir and SafariWatir) (Ruby)<br />
Watir is a driver for IE, Firefox, and Safari.&nbsp;Watir runns on Windows, Mac and Linux. Obviously IE and Safari are only available on Windows respectively Mac. <br />
The IE and Firefox drivers are stable. <br />
Technically IE is driven thorough the COM-Interop.&nbsp;Firefox is driven through a Firefox-Plugin. <br />
The Safari driver is experimental.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://watij.com/" style="font-size: 14px;">Watij - WebSpec</a> (Java)<br />
Watij was Initially a port of Watir to Java.<br />
It seems to have become a project of its own. The latest release is called WebSpec and features a new and unique API. <br />
Implemented in Java it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux and supports remoting of IE, Mozilla and Safari. <br />
There is also a JRuby API for it.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://watin.sourceforge.net/" style="font-size: 14px;">WatiN</a> (.NET)<br />
WatiN is a port of Watir to .NET. Implemented in .NET it offers a browser automation API.<br />
It runs on Windows and supports remoting of IE. <br />
The newest release also supports remoting of Firefox through a Firefos plugin. <br />
Latest release is from December 2009, which is a bit scary...<br />
<br />
<a href="http://seleniumhq.org/" style="font-size: 14px;">Selenium</a> (Standalone, Integrating with Java, .NET, Ruby and more)<br />
Selenium is a very sophisticated web-testing solution.<br />
It  is an in-browser test driver. It automates the browser to run the  test steps. This automation is run from within the browser itself. The  runtime for automating the browser is actually a JavaScript library that  is loaded&nbsp; into the browser. This runtime then automates the browser  interactions which are executed in another frame or window.<br />
On the  client the Selenium-RC-Server (remote control) is responsible for  controlling the in-browser runtime. The Selenium-RC-Server is is implemented in Java. So to run the server, you need Java installed.<br />
Finally your tests written in any supported platform (Java, .NET, Ruby ...) are interacting with the Selenium-RC server.<br />
Selenium  supports automating all major Browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari,  Opera, Konqueror and more). Since the runtime is executed in the  browser, JavaScript has to be enabled.<br />
Selenium is very powerful.  However it comes with a certain complexity and fragility since you  depend on the correct interactions of several involved components.<br />
Selenium  also comes with SeleniumIDE, a Firefox Plugin to record interactions  with the browser. Note: The interactions recorded in Firefox can also be  run against other browsers later.<br />
Another component is Selenium  Grid, an infrastructure which enables to run Selenium tests on multiple  servers against different browsers in parallel.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://webtest.canoo.com/" style="font-size: 14px;">Canoo WebTest</a> (Standalone, Java, Groovy)<br />
Canoo WebTest is a free open source tool for automated testing of web applications in a very effective way.<br />
WebTest is built on top of HtmlUnit. Tha means it is an out-of-browser testing tool. <br />
Since  it is not an in-browser testing-tool, you cannot be sure that the  browser is behaving exactly the same, but HtmlUnit is very mature and  has reliable JavaScript support.<br />
Test steps can be written in xml or  in Groovy. Those steps then can be easily combined to test scripts.  Almost no programming skills are required.<br />
Canoo Web Test integrates with Ant and can be run as standalone tool.<br />
Very nice reports out of the box. If a test is failing you get a screenshot of the last page where the failure occured.<br />
You need Java installed.<br />
<a href="http://mguillem.wordpress.com/2007/10/29/webtest-vs-selenium-webtest-wins-13-5/">Here is a good comparison</a> between Canoo Web Test and Selenium.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd286726.aspx" style="font-size: 14px;">CodedUI</a> (.NET)<br />
Visual Studio 2010 comes with CodedUI.<br />
With CodedUI you can create tests that automate the browser. <br />
All the tutorials show how to use CodedUI with a Recorder and with Visual Studio TestManager.<br />
But behind the scenes CodedUI seems to be a purely programmatic API: the recorder generates C# code (although not very readable).<br />
But  theoretically the programatic API of CodedUI can be used to write  UI-automatin tests from scratch. However I think an abstraction layer on  top of CodedUI would be needed to write those tests effectively.<br />

<a href="http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2009/03/27/first-steps-with-lightweight-test-automation-framework/">For an introduction see this blog-post</a> by Steve Sanderson.<br />
The <span class="CodePlexPageHeader" id="s1v3">Lightweight Test Automation Framework</span> is a framework to test ASP.NET applications. It works with WebForms and MVC).<br />
Tests are written in any .NET language, deployed alongside with your application and then run in the browser.<br />
Since test execution is started through the web-interface, r<a href="http://www.jacopretorius.net/2009/06/lightweight-test-automation-framework.html">unning the tests in a automated build is a bit tricky</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.getwindmill.com/" style="font-size: 14px;">Windmill</a> (Standalone, Python)<br />
Windmill is a web testing tool designed to let you painlessly automate and debug your web application.<br />

<br />
<a href="http://celerity.rubyforge.org/" style="font-size: 14px;">Celerity</a><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span>(JRuby)<br />
Celerity is a JRuby wrapper around HtmlUnit.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://github.com/langalex/culerity" style="font-size: 14px;">Culerity</a> (Ruby): <br />
Culerity integrate celerity and cucumber running on ruby <br />
Culerity is a wrapper around Celerity to allow it to be called from MRI<br />
You need to have JRuby installed.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://github.com/jnicklas/capybara" style="font-size: 14px;">Capybara</a><br />
Capybara is a DSL for interacting with a webapplication. It is agnostic about the  driver running your tests and currently comes bundled with rack-test,  Culerity, Celerity and Selenium support built in.﻿<br />
Capybara provides a  common API (the DSL) that is then run either on rack-test, Culerity,  Celerity or Selenium. The newest addition is a driver that runs on  <a href="http://github.com/smparkes/capybara-envjs">env.js</a>, a JavaScript environment, that runs out of the browser.<br />
It seems to become the de facto choice in combination with Cucumber, replacing Webrat.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/?redir=1" style="font-size: 14px;">WebDriver / Selenium2</a> (Java)<br />
For an explanation what the relationship between WebDriver and Selenium2 <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/docs/09_webdriver.html">see the Selenium documentation</a>.<br />
WebDriver  is another wrapper around other web-testing frameworks that provides a  consistent API how to interact with web applications.<br />
WebDriver has been merged with Selenium 2. The resulting situation is not very clear yet...<br />
The project seems promising but is still very much under development.<br />
WebDriver  currently provides four different driver implementation: HtmlUnitDriver  for out-of-browser testing, FireFoxDriver, InternetExplorerDriver and  ChromeDriver for the respective browsers.<br />
WebDriver is mainly a Java  project, however a .NET version exists, however it is not very clear  which features are supported in .NET.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://jwebunit.sourceforge.net/" style="font-size: 14px;">JWebUnit</a> (Java)<br />
Wrapper around HtmlUnit and Selenium, providing a unified Java API. In this regard the same goal as WebDriver.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://github.com/jarib/watir-webdriver" style="font-size: 14px;">Watir-Webdriver</a><br />
This  is watir sitting on top of webdriver. This allows you to use the  Watir-API and control any browser that is supported by WebDriver.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/aost/" style="font-size: 14px;">Tellurium</a> (Groovy)<br />
Tellurium  is a UI module-based automated testing framework for web applications.  The approach it takes is to describe the UI declaratively in modules and  then formulate test steps against those modules. When the web-site  changes you only have to update the modules, not the steps.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/" style="font-size: 14px;">MVCContib</a> (.NET)<br />
The MVCContrib projects contains some abstractions over WatiN for testing ASP.NET MVC applications.<br />
These are helpers in MvcContrib.TestHelper.Ui and WatinDriver.<br />
However  the documentation of those helpers is poor. The best place is to look  at the CodeCampServer project and Chapter 20 in the book ASP.Net MVC 2  in Action.<br />
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://github.com/tenderlove/mechanize" style="font-size: 14px;">Mechanize</a><br />
The Mechanize library is used for automating interaction with websites.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://nokogiri.org/" style="font-size: 14px;">Nokogiri</a><br />
An HTML, XML, SAX, &amp; Reader parser with the ability to search documents via XPath or CSS3 selectors.<br />
Implemented in Ruby.<br />
Usually  you don't use Nokogiri directly in your automated web-tests. However  this library is used by a lot of the higher level Ruby web-testing  libraries mentioned here.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://github.com/hpricot/hpricot" style="font-size: 14px;">hpricot</a><br />
Hpricot is a library with a Ruby-API for parsing HTML. It is written in C and therefore very swift.<br />
Hpricot is an alternative to Nokogiri.<br />
As  with Nokogiri you don't usually use Hpricot directly in your automated  web-tests. However this library is used by someof the higher level Ruby  web-testing libraries mentioned here.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would be interested in your experiences with web testing tools. Do you know other tools that fit the characteristics of &nbsp;"Agile Web Testing Tools"?
