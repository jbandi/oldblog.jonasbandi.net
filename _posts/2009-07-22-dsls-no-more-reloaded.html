Some month ago I was skeptical about lightheartedly jumping into DSL-creation, and <a href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2008/10/have-i-lost-my-faith.html">I was wondering if I had lost my faith</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Then I realized that I was not the only one: <a href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2009/02/dsls-are-people-loosing-their-faith.html">Other people have lost their faith...</a>

<div style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px"><a href="http://michaelfeathers.typepad.com/michael_feathers_blog/2008/11/how-to-fail-with-external-dsls.html">Michael Feathers: How To Fail With External DSLs</a></div>
<br/>

<blockquote>There are more external DSLs out there than most people realize and more often than not, I see companies trying to get rid of them.</blockquote>

This is an interesting post by Michael Feather. 
<br/>
I did not know that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)">Erlang</a> was dropped by Ericsson (aka. open-sourced) because thy were concerned with their ability to hire and train developers.
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>The thing to remember about DSLs is that they are a commitment and the commitment doesnâ€™t end when the initial implementation is done.</blockquote>
