<p>From the article about <a href="http://martinfowler.com/apsupp/appfacades.pdf">Application Facades</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to come up with a clever way to do something if a simple way works fine. So this approach has limitations. Always ask yourself if you can live with the limitations &mdash; if you can you should. You can always make it more complicated later.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;A simple testing framework makes life easier. As you go on you can add more tests, but you never throw tests away. Not unless you like driving at night with your lights off.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I like it when bits of programs don&rsquo;t know what other bits are doing.&rdquo;</li></ul>
