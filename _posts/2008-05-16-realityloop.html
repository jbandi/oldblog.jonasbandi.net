Last week, I was a the <a href="http://www.sigs-datacom.de/sd/kongresse/set_2008/index.htm">SET 2008</a>.

<br/>
One particularly funny tidbit was the close occurrence of the following two quotes.

In a panel discussion about 'software engineering tomorrow' a sarcastic comment about the failed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_software_engineering">CASE</a> hype in the 80ies was made. Allegedly, the promise of some tool-vendor was:

<blockquote>Y<strong>ou don't have to program any more! Just fill in the method-bodies.
</strong></blockquote>
<br/>

The whole audience was laughing...

<br/>
A bit earlier this day, there was a session about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Driven_Architecture">'Event Driven Architecture'</a>. Basically this was a product presentation of <a href="http://www.sigs-datacom.de/sd/kongresse/set_2008/index.htm">BEA Event Server</a> and its application in a real-world scenario. At the end one of the speaker proudly declared:


<blockquote><strong>Because of our framework we do almost no programming any more! All we do, is a lot of scripting and configuration.</strong></blockquote>
<br/>
This time the audience was expected to be impressed ...
