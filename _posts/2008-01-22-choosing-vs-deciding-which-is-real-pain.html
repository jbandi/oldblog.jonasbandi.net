<p>Googling for "Pain" (don't ask!), I tripped over this funny <a href="http://bokardo.com/archives/comic-user-pain/">picture</a>:</p> <p><a href="http://bokardo.com/archives/comic-user-pain/" atomicselection="true"><img src="http://bokardo.com/images/comics/user-pain.gif"></a> </p> <p>The green guy seems to have grasped the <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/articles/tell-dont-ask">"Tell, Don't Ask"-Principle</a>, which can be applied in a much broader context than just programming.</p> <p>But&nbsp;often the situation is the other way round:</p> <p>Blue Guy: <em>"Just tell me what you want."<br></em>Green Guy: <em>"Cant't you just give me a list to choose from?"<br></em><font size="1">(Zapping TV-channels, anyone?)</font></p> <p>A person I worked with once said: "Usually the customer has to be forced to his&nbsp;happiness!"<br><br>The next step leads into the&nbsp;realm of manipulation: Forcing the other side while giving the impression of leaving a choice... but that's a dangerous dance on the edge between a win-win-situation and a psychological warfare.</p> <p><font size="1">PS: Do not confuse the <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/articles/tell-dont-ask">"Tell, Don't Ask"-Principle</a> with the </font><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_ask,_don't_tell"><font size="1">"Don't Tell, Don't Ask"-Policy</font></a><font size="1"> ...</font></p> <p><font size="1">PPS:&nbsp;I thought about naming&nbsp;this&nbsp;post "<a href="http://closed-loop.blogspot.com/2007/06/heading-for-madness-part-1-paranoia.html">Heading for Madness</a>, Part 1.5"...</font></p>
