<p>One of the most impressive memories from my <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/pages/CSM">Certified Scrum Master</a> course last year, is the experience of growing a self enabling team.</p><p>The exercise was simple:</p><ul><li>Given was a bucket full of tennis balls.</li><li>The team was about 20 people. </li><li>Only one team member could take balls out of the bucket. He could take out as many as he liked at any time throughout the sprint.</li><li>The team would score a point for each tennis ball that was touched by every team member <em>and then touched again </em>by the first team member, he who took the ball out of the bucket.</li><li>The team would do 10 sprints. Each sprint is 2 min. Between two sprints is a break of 2 min for retrospective and optimization.</li><li>Before each sprint the team announces the score it expects to achieve.</li></ul><p>Before the exercise I thought that the main challenge would be figuring out the optimal formation of the team members. I expected that after that there will not be much improvement possible.</p><p>I was wrong! This was the result (second column: expected, third column: achieved):</p><p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_X3kaawac_g4/TGUDO9ETJSI/AAAAAAAAA24/CFY4cyks4kQ/ScrumGame_small.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="ScrumGame_small.jpg" width="300" height="400" /></p><p>I am still amazed how the team was able to optimize and improve in each of the ten sprints. This improvement was rooted entirely in the team itself and is a perfect demonstration for a self enabling team, that was given the chance to inspect and adapt.</p><p>Some of the optimization steps included:</p><ul><li>Finding out the optimal formation for the task: a circle.</li><li>Optimizing the formation into two circles of people. The outer facing inward and the inner facing outward, this way we could pass the balls to a person in front of us and not besides us.</li><li>Ignore dropped balls, continue with the flow.</li><li>Not throwing balls to your peer, but dropping them into his cupped hands.</li><li>Passing two balls at a time to your peer.</li><li>Sitting down on the floor reduces the danger/consequences of dropped balls.</li></ul>
