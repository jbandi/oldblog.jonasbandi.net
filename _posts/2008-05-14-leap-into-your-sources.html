<a href="http://www.ironicsoftware.com/leap/index.html">Leap</a> seems to be quite an interesting product.
It aims to be an alternative to the Finder in Mac OS X.
<br/>
<br/>
Leap implements some advanced and interesting UI-concepts. Especially the "Go Deep"-mode combined with filtering allows interesting usages.
<br/>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/jonas.bandi/SCoXQ876ZkI/AAAAAAAAAOY/8iP7sGGiIyI/Picture%201.png?imgmax=800" alt="Picture 1.png" border="0" width="420" /></div>
<br/>
In combination with <a href="http://closed-loop.blogspot.com/2008/01/enhancing-quick-look.html">Quick Look</a>, Leap can really be helpful.
<br/>
Especially when browsing through java projects with their nested directory structure Leap can help you avoid to step up and down the directory ladder i.e. when looking at a domain object and a related service.
<br/>
<br/>
Leap offers a lot of other features (like tagging), but I have not yet found the way to using them efficiently ...
<br/>
<br/>
But I have not yet decided if it is really worth it's price for me ...
