The concept of conversations is crucial when developing web applications.
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Conversation</em> is quite a new buzz-word in the industry. It fits somewhere between stateful-navigation, flow-control and <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html">Unit of Work</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
I first came across the concept when I was looking into <a href="http://www.seamframework.org/">Seam</a>.
<br/>
I think the developers of seam heavily coined the term and the importance of the concept.
<br/>
<br/>
In the Java world the foremost concern of conversations is to integrate the UI-framwork with your persistence-framework.
<br/>
<br/>

Apart from <a href="http://www.seamframework.org/">Seam</a> others have tackled the challenge. Currently I am specificlly looking into the following two frameworks:
<br/>
<br/>

<list>
<li><a href="http://springframework.org/webflow">Spring Web Flow</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://myfaces.apache.org/orchestra/index.html">Apache MyFaces Orchestra</a>
</li>
</list> 



<br/>
Of course <a href="http://grails.codehaus.org/">Grails</a> (based on Spring Web Flow) offers also concepts that go in the same direction.
