Scott Bellware:
<blockquote>
I don't think we have a lot of productivity in software development! I think we have a lot of productivity built around the <em>moment of creation</em> of software, which is such an infinitely short period of time. It is relatively insignificant to what we should be concerned with, which is the massive amount of time which we spend in maintenance and extension.

Ted Neward:
<blockquote>
Sounds kind of like having kids. The moment of creation is short and pleasurable and then you get eighteen years of maintenance!
