### [Software is not made of bricks](https://leanpub.com/shippingsoftware/read#leanpub-auto-software-is-not-made-of-bricks)

> Once you understand that software is not a simple pile of bricks, you understand that the minimum level of competence required to contribute positively to a project is non-trivial.

I think this essay should be a "must read" for anyone involved into software development. It shows the problems with the widespread mentality that developing a piece of software is like building something fairly simple out of bricks.
One point which shows the fundamental difference between laying bricks and software development particularly stuck with me: Skilled developers typically come up with solutions that are simpler and consist of less code than less skilled developers. This does not fit a "brick mentality", where you have a fixed amount of bricks to move.


### [ChakraCore is now Open-Source](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2016/01/13/chakracore-now-open/)
The JavaScript engine by Microsoft is now  available under the MIT License at the [ChakraCore GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore) repository.

There is already a [pull request](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4765) to make Node.js run on ChakraCore. And there is a new [node-chakracore repo](https://github.com/nodejs/node-chakracore) under the Node.js Foundation. Unfortunately it seems that it is only working on windows for now ...


### [Project Raider](http://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2016/01/13/project-rider-a-csharp-ide/)
JetBrains is building a cross-platform C# IDE ... the missing piece in true cross-platform .NET development.


### [Angular 2 versus React: There Will Be Blood](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/angular-2-versus-react-there-will-be-blood-66595faafd51#.p8agyuokh)
Of course the title is link-bait and the article is provocative. But it is still a good comparison between the different approaches and concepts used in Angular2 and React.

The talk gives a good overview to different approaches for data-binding in current web-frameworks. It also explains the concept and benefits of using a virtual dom.

### Piracy in online education

There was a lot of money to be made if you got into online education early: [Scott Allen earned over one million dollars in 2013 from his Pluralsight courses!](http://blog.pluralsight.com/online-educations-millionaire-teacher) 

Today the landscape looks not that promising any more... especially [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) seems to attract/enable piracy and price-dumping:

### [The Sad State of Web Development](https://medium.com/@wob/the-sad-state-of-web-development-1603a861d29f#.bgtq6a2og)

> The web (specifically the Javascript/Node community) has created some of the most complicated, convoluted, over engineered tools ever conceived.

A very critical view on the current trends in web development. The author seems pretty frustrated ... but he has some points.

> Happy people don’t leave jobs they love

An accurate analysis how people get to the point where they quit their job. I have gone through that process many times in my career ...
