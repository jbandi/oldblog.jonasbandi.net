<p>I am currently working for a team that is about to build a web frontend for their in-house legacy system. The web frontend is basically a greenfield project, and the team can freely choose their technology stack.</p>

<p>I developed a small technology prototype in <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. For both solutions I used npm and <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a> as a build environement. In the AngularJS solution I used <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> and in the React solution I used <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/">ES2015</a> (formerly ES6) and <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>.</p>

<p>The prototype is here: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jonasbandi/webshop/">https://bitbucket.org/jonasbandi/webshop/</a></p>

<p>I presented both solutions to the team, and let them decide which stack they like to choose for the actual project.</p>

<p>The team decided that they felt more comfortable with the solution based on React.</p>

<p>There were two main reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>AngularJS is currently in a strange state, since Angular 2.0 is announced and hyped but not ready for production yet. If you start a project based on AngularJS now, you get the feeling that you are writing in a legacy technology right from the beginning.</li>
<li>The React solution left a conciser impression and was clearer to grasp by the team. For example to realize a “component” in AngularJS you have to understand Directives (a DDO is pretty arcane for a newbie) and the implementation is spread over several entities (DDO, controller, template …). In contrast to that the approach of React to components is much easier to grasp.</li>
</ul>

<p>This decision was made some weeks ago. In the meantime I set up the real project with the following components:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Build based on npm, <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a>, <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> and <a href="http://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> (no gulp or grunt)</li>
<li><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> 0.14 / <a href="https://github.com/rackt/react-router">ReactRouter</a> 1.0</li>
<li>Flux architecture based on <a href="http://alt.js.org/">Alt.js</a></li>
<li>Internationalization with <a href="http://i18next.com/">i18next</a></li>
</ul>
