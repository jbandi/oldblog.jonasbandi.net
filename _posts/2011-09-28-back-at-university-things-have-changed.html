<p>Recently I started studying for <a href="http://www.mas-mtec.ethz.ch/">MAS-MTEC</a> at ETH ZÃ¼rich.</p><p>A characteristic of this post graduate studies is that most lectures are shared with graduate students.</p><p>I am impressed at how much studying today has changed from when I was studying a decade ago. This impressively shows how fast technology is changing the way we live, which I seem to forget in my every-day life.</p><p>The internet is ubiquitous when studying today: The studies are officially organized over the internet (lecture selection, examination registration, learning material distribution, task assignments, group formation for exercises ...). <br />

One lecture even has a <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23marketingmtec">twitter hashtag</a>. <br />
<br />
Consequently practically every student is bringing a laptop or tablet to the lectures. I never have seen such a high local density of MacBooks as in the Marketing lecture :-)</p><p>Comparing that to when I started studying 12 years ago: I did not even own a cell-phone yet ... I also clearly remember when a lecture assistant suggested to use "Google", and I had never heard that strange term ...</p>
