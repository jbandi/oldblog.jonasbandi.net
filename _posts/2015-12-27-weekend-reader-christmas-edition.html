<h3 id="angular-2-is-officially-beta"><a href="http://angularjs.blogspot.ch/2015/12/angular-2-beta.html">Angular 2 is officially beta</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re now confident that most developers can be successful building large applications using Angular 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/">The developer guides</a> are already amazingly polished. If you have not yet started to look into this new framework, now is a good time.</p>
<h3 id="we-have-closed-the-hype-cycle"><a href="https://angularclass.com/angular-2-for-react-developers/">We have closed the hype-cycle</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://angularclass.com/angular-2-for-react-developers/">The post</a> is a good high-level overview comparing the basic concepts of React and Angular 2.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year we have seen <a href="http://www.stridenyc.com/blog/coming-to-react-from-angular/">posts that were explaining React</a> to developers that know Angular. Now we have posts that explain Angular 2 to developers that know React…</p>
<h3 id="angular-2-for-desktop-apps"><a href="https://auth0.com/blog/2015/12/15/create-a-desktop-app-with-angular-2-and-electron/">Angular 2 for Desktop Apps</a></h3>
<p>Angular 2 promises to be a framework not only for web development but also for mobile development. <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/2015/12/15/create-a-desktop-app-with-angular-2-and-electron/">This article</a> show how the reach can even be extended to the Desktop by using <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>.</p>
<h3 id="jazoon-in-bern-the-future-of-web-development"><a href="http://jazoon.com/">Jazoon in Bern: The future of Web Development</a></h3>
<p>On April 4th there will take place the <a href="http://jazoon.com/">Jazoon TechDays</a> on the beautiful Gurten. Traditionally Jazoon was a multi-track Java conference. For the next year however the organizers came up with a new concept of a one-day conference that focuses on a single topic. The topic for the upcoming conference in Bern is “The Future of Web Development” and they already have an interesting line-up of speakers (and I heard the rumor that there will even be more international speakers announced soon …).<br>
I suggest you should get your ticket for that event soon, even if you are not living in Bern. I was lucky and could convince <a href="http://www.ivorycode.com/">my employer</a> to sponser my ticket :-)</p>
<h3 id="redux-screencast"><a href="https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux">Redux Screencast</a></h3>
<p>Dan Abramov, the creator of <a href="http://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>, created an amazing series of screencasts for Egghead. It is one of the most instructive screencasts I have watched the whole year. And it is available for free!<br>
If you want to learn about <a href="http://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> and how it approaches the ideas of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/">Flux</a> you should definitely watch these short lessons.<br>
But even if Redux/Flux is not a topic that interests you, the screencasts teach a lot about using ES6 and test-driven development in JavaScript.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-of-javascript-is-almost-now"><a href="http://sdtimes.com/the-future-of-javascript-is-almost-now/">The future of JavaScript is (almost) now</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Every once in a while, a piece of technology is situated in the right place at the right time, and it ends up taking over the world. […] ES6 is new foundation for what may be the most important programming language of the next several decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article is good overview over the JavaScript ecosystem today and its relevance in the future.</p>
<h3 id="the-end-of-dynamic-languages"><a href="http://elbenshira.com/blog/the-end-of-dynamic-languages/">The End of Dynamic Languages</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Working in dynamic languages is fine if you’re just <em>adding</em> a feature on top of the pile of features. But anything else is impossibly difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not everybody agrees with the future relevance of JavaScript. According to the article the time for dynamic languages is over and it is time to move on.</p>
