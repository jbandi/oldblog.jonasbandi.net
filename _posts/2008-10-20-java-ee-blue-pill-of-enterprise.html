One thing that stroke me, when I <a href="http://closed-loop.blogspot.com/2008/08/alternatives-to-hibernate.html">first came across</a> <a href="http://carbonado.sourceforge.net/">Carbonado</a> was that it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonado_%28Java%29">was originally developed</a> by Amazon for internal use.
<br/>
<br/>
This is another example where a real big boy is not using standard technologies that are brain-fed to foot-soldiers like me out here in the trenches of enterprise development. [Other examples are all the upcoming cloud-technologies: <a href="http://appengine.google.com/">Google AppEngine</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/">Amazon SimpleDB</a>, Microsoft Strata ...]
<br/>
<br/>

Those tools are not really attractive and provoke a lot of suffering, but hey that's the price for being part of <em>the enterprise</em>!
<br/>
<br/>
Strangely, very often I stumble across enterprise-applications, that were entirely developed with those tools in a totally brainwashed and conform way. But they still suffer from exactly the problems that the tools promise to prevent (like performance, scalability, maintainability ...).
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, sometimes I get a glimpse behind the scenes of the real big boys, like eBay, Amazon or Google... and I get the impression, that there is not much of Java EE there. <br/>

<br/>
I wonder, why might that be? Maybe I should start looking for the red pill...
