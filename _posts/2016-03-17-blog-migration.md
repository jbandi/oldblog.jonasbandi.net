title: Blog Migration
---


Last week I migrated my blog away from Blogger.com to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

With this step I am trying to streamline the tooling around my blogging activities, and as a result I hope to blog more in the future.

The full sources of my Bog including all the posts are now [available on Github](https://github.com/jbandi/blog.jonasbandi.net/).

I migrated all my posts to the new blog, but the layout of some old posts will be broken. My old blog is still available at [http://old-blog.jonasbandi.net/](http://old-blog.jonasbandi.net/).
