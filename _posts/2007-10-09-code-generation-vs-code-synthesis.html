<p>In one of the latest DNR-Interviews Venkat Subramanium makes an interesting statement:</p> <blockquote> <p>I think code-generation is so 20th century! What you want is code-synthesis.</p> <p>With code-synthesis&nbsp;a method is actually generated in memory on the fly, it is never created on the disk for you to mess with.</p> <p>With code generation, the minute you generate the code, its like an itch in the back. You want to modify it, you want to scratch&nbsp;it a little bit and then it turns into a sore after a while.</p></blockquote> <p align="right">-Venkat Subramanium, <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=277">DNR 277</a> [36min 30s]</p> <p align="left">&nbsp;</p> <p align="left">I think the distinction between code-generation and code-synthesis is very fluent. The C# compiler is basically just a code-generator (it generates IL-code). ASP.Net is also a code generator that generates IL from ASPX-pages (and code-behind).</p> <p align="left"><a href="http://www.realityloop.net/blog/CodeGenerationvs.CodeSynthesis_1C95/image.png" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="285" alt="image" src="http://www.realityloop.net/blog/CodeGenerationvs.CodeSynthesis_1C95/image_thumb.png" width="248" align="left" border="0"></a> In the case of ASP.Net I personally would also talk about code-synthesis, because the generation process is almost completely hidden from the developer and also happens (almost) at run-time and not at compile-time.</p> <p align="left">This is in contrast to classical code-generation that is promoted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture">MDA</a> or tools like <a href="http://www.codesmithtools.com/">CodeSmith</a> and <a href="http://www.mygenerationsoftware.com/">MyGeneration</a> ...</p> <p align="left">Traditional static languages lend themselves to code-generation. Code-synthesis on the fly is a rather complicated endeavor (who does really understand how ASP.Net works under the hood?).</p> <p align="left">Modern dynamic languages like Ruby or Groovy&nbsp;are much better qualified for code-synthesis.&nbsp;Since they are interpreted, there is a much more powerful runtime to begin with. Furthermore they offer powerful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a> capabilities. This makes dynamic runtime-behavior much more feasible, which in turn is the base for creating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_programming_language">DSLs</a> or code-synthesis.</p> <p align="left">Just to exemplify the consequences of the differences between code-generation and code-synthesis:</p> <p align="left">Look at the following&nbsp;ActiveRecord model:</p><pre> <strong>class</strong> Firm &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
   has_many   :clients
   has_one    :account
   belongs_to :conglomorate
 <strong>end</strong></pre>
<p align="left">And now think about all the lines code that get generated, if you want to realize the same model with a strongly typed DataSet...</p>
