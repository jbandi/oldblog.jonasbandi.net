Of course I am only <a href="http://davybrion.com/blog/2011/06/you-might-want-to-start-taking-javascript-seriously/">repeating what others</a> are preaching about the recent <a href="http://dannorth.net/2011/12/19/the-rise-and-rise-of-javascript/">rise of JavaScript</a>.<br />
<br />
But I think the movement is significant and can't be overstated. And recent developments are really even making it more and more interesting.<br />
<br />
Nobody can deny hat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is the de facto programming language of Html5. Every other language trying to bolt itself onto Html5 looks like pure friction so far. And Html5 is looking upon a prospering future.<br />
<br />
Today we are used to some established JavaScript frameworks that make working with JavaScript more fun and productive. <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> seems to emerge as the clear leader by popularity here.<br />
<br />
More recently<a href="http://codebrief.com/2012/01/the-top-10-javascript-mvc-frameworks-reviewed/"> tons of javascript application frameworks</a> (so called MVC frameworks) are emerging, that facilitate programming complex applications inside the browser and taking most of the traditional presentation-logic away from the server.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://nodejs.org/" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="100" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-paluGXhk-8s/Tym6PfvGp9I/AAAAAAAABJY/Ehjgd7UWack/s320/nodejs.png" style="border: none;" width="220" /></a></div>
On the other hand we have the <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> ecosystem that takes JavaScript to the server and allows us to use the same language, concepts, libraries and tools for the full application development stack.<br />
And that ecosystem is thriving! JavaScript is the <a href="https://github.com/languages">most popular langage on GitHub</a> ... and have a look at the impressive <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules">node modules list</a>.<br />
<br />
Now this is all well and <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/AlphaGeek.html">alpha-geeky</a>, but there are showing up the first "real-world" success stories: <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/03/01/the_rise_and_rise_of_node_dot_js/">Voxer</a>, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/24/why-walmart-is-using-node-js/">Walmart</a>, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2011/08/16/linkedin-node/">LinkedIn</a> ...<br />
<br />
Of course there are <a href="http://teddziuba.com/2011/10/node-js-is-cancer.html">the critics</a>.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly Microsoft recently positioned itself to become one of the most influencing conveyor of the JavaScript hype. It seems that they are investing heavily into JavaScript on different frontiers:<br />
<br />
Microsoft was <a href="http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/06/23/porting-node-to-windows-with-microsoft%E2%80%99s-help/">pushing node.js onto the the Windows environment</a>.<br />
Now they are <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/">pushing it into their Azure cloud platform</a>. And <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/tutorials/deploying-with-cloud9/">evolving a 3rd party ecosystem around that</a>.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="float: right; text-align: center;">
<img border="0" height="120" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GyiFQw-SVLc/Tyl7te9DLfI/AAAAAAAABJQ/19iB-ne5kIE/s320/w8.jpg" style="border: none;" width="200" /></div>
But probably the biggest step for the future of JavaScript is the new strategy of Microsoft for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8">Windows 8</a> desktop and tablet applications (Metro style apps). While there are several options for developing Metro style apps, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465380.aspx">JavaScript seems to become a major pillar</a>.<br />
This move opens up yet another area for JavaScript and JavaScript developers, completely adjacent to the web.<br />
Developing for the desktop (or tablet) will most likely always be pretty different than for the web. For Metro style apps there will be a lot of new concepts, libraries and tools that are different to the ones that are used in web development (just have a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Runtime">WinRT</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465493.aspx">WinJS</a> ...).<br />
But the desktop- and the web-stack will move closer together and JavaScript with HTML5 and CSS will be the common denominator. Which I think is a very interesting evolution.<br />
For instance look at this <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Groove-Drum-Sequencer-cc6028ec">example of a drum sequencer</a> (a traditional client application) that is using JavaScript and jQuery for its UI.<br />
The prospect of reusing code and knowhow between desktop-ui- and web-ui-programming seems tempting ... even if a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/ursenzler/status/162793217425801216">.NET developers</a> and <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/gotoAarhus2011.html">other gurus</a> are not so thrilled by the prospect of omnipresent JavaScript.<br />
<br />
Of course another interesting thing will be to see how Metro style apps will change the architecture of future desktop applications. I think some concepts from web development will get adopted into desktop development. A stricter enforcement of separation between UI- and backend-components within a single application will most probably be a result (i.e. there seems to be no notion of traditional data-access in WinRT).<br />
