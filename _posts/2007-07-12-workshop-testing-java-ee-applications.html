Last semester I was attending this course myself. Testing was a topic I sorely missed, and I stated this in the feedback-survey.<br>Soon afterwards I met the main lecturer of the course at the <a href="http://berner-architekten-treffen.ch/">BAT</a>, and we started a discussion about how to address testing in the course and how I could get involved (@Patrick: Thanks for bringing up the topic!).</p> <p>This workshop was the first result. I am looking forward to repeat the workshop next semester.</p> <p>The feedback I got from the&nbsp;attendees was really good. For my part I had a lot of fun holding the workshop, and I learned a lot. The attendees were extremely cooperative. The result&nbsp;was a lot of discussions and exchange of experience and opinions.</p> <p>There are some topics I did not include this time, mainly because of a lack of preparation-time. I will try to include these in the next version:</p> <ul> <li>Test Driven Design  <li>Continuous Integration  <li>Automated Acceptance Testing (<a href="http://fit.c2.com/">FIT</a>/<a href="http://fitnesse.org/">Fitnesse</a>)</li></ul> <p>Furthermore I plan to switch to Keynote on my new MacBook for presentations. It just has more style...</p>
