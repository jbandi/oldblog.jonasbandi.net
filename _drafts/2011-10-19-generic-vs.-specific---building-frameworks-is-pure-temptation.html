<div style="width: 400px;"><blockquote>Responsibility trap number one: Building a platform to make other (lesser) programmers more productive.</blockquote><p>- Eric Evans at SET 2008</p></div><p>Everybody working on large scale frameworks today should have a look at the entertaining presentation by Stefan Tilkov: <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Generic-Specific-Tradeoffs-Stefan-Tilkov">Generic vs. Specific.</a><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Generic-Specific-Tradeoffs-Stefan-Tilkov"></a></p><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Generic-Specific-Tradeoffs-Stefan-Tilkov"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_X3kaawac_g4/S4lcUHufNdI/AAAAAAAAAxI/qkD7zO9PjaA/Screen%20shot%202010-02-27%20at%206.46.14%20PM.png?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="Screen shot 2010-02-27 at 6.46.14 PM.png" width="340" /></a></div><p><br /><br /></p><p> </p><p>My favorite provoking statement from the presentation:</p><blockquote>Some programmers, when faces with a problem turn to a generic solution ... now they have two problems.</blockquote><p><br /><br /> I have seen so many unsuccessful or semi-successful attempts at creating "The Framework" that I get immediately very suspicious when I come to a project that is using a (homegrown) framework. <br /><br /> Of course in todays enterprise IT it is difficult to tell the difference between a library, a technology stack/platform and a framework. However <br /><br /> Usually the intent behind building "The Framework" was to build something more specific as the existing technology stack/platform or the common libraries. But what they usually end up with is a more generic solution than when implementing the required system on the given platform. <br /> The promise is to be more productive with this custom generic foundation than with only the generic platform. However this is difficult to measure and often I have the impression that compared to the specific solution the semi generic solution takes 50% to build the framework, 20% to implement the usecases that fit to the indeded usages of "The Tramework" and another 50% to implement that unforseen usecases that do not fit "The Framework".</p><p> </p><p>Another funny observation from the presentation is the phases in a developers life:</p><ol><li>The Enthusiastic Developer - "Lets build programs for real people"</li><li>The Disillusioned Developer - "Real people have boring problems"</li><li>The Enthusiastic Architect - "Lets build the generic thing machine"</li><li>The Disillusioned Architect - "YAGNI, KISS"</li></ol><p> </p><div style="align: right; font-size: 10px; clear: right;"><br /><p><a href="http://twitter.com/jbandi"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;" src="http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=twitter.com" border="0" alt="http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=twitter.com" height="13px" align="left" /> follow me on twitter, I need some friends :-)</a></p></div><p> </p>
