<p>Currently there seems to be a second wave of cloud platforms.</p><p>The first wave were:</p><p>Google App Engine (GEA)</p><p>Amazon EC2</p><p>Windows Azure</p><p>VMWare / SpringSource</p><p>Rackspace http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/</p><p> </p><p>These are the big players in the industry.</p><p> </p><p>The second wave now sits on top of these platforms. Interestingy there seem to be small companies:</p><p>- Heroku (for Ruby)</p><p>- CloudBees (for Java)</p><p>- AppHarbor (for .NET)</p><p>- Moncai</p><p>- http://www.springsource.com/code2cloud</p><p> </p><p>This second wave does not only focus on scalability but it focuses on the whole deployment and application lifecycle management topic.</p><p>They try to promote a workflow that takes place fully in the cloud. Not only the hosting of the productive app is happening in the cloud but also the other phases of the application lifecycle:</p><p>Source control in the cloud</p><p>Build services / continuous integration in the cloud</p><p>Deployment happening in the cloud</p><p>Seamless integration of deployment, development and source control</p><p> </p><p>Bunch of providers coming:</p><p>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3648993/where-can-i-host-a-node-js-app</p><p> </p><p>Next step: Editor in the Cloud</p><p>http://cloud9ide.com/</p><p>http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion</p><p>http://codemirror.net/</p><p>http://www.coderun.com/</p><p> </p><p> </p>
