Example isn't another way to teach, it is the only way to teach.&nbsp;<br />

I am following up on my post "<a href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2011/08/test-driven-it-is-mindset-not-tool.html">Test Driven: It is the mindset not the tool!</a>", where I argued that the most valuable aspect of TDD is the mindset of&nbsp;<b>gaining insights and evolving through rapid feedback</b> and establishing a <b>methodology of trial &amp; error to guide towards progress.</b><br />
<br />
Don't focus on the single right plan! Start with something and learn from the experience.<br />
Learning is the key when dealing with the unknown.<br />
And TDD is actually the perfect tool to institutionalize learning. It is the formalization of evolution through trial and error. It helps you to focus on your intentions and to verify them continuously. It helps you to make this process transparent and documented.<br />

This goes hand in hand with Dan Norths concept of <a href="http://blog.dannorth.net/2010/08/30/introducing-deliberate-discovery/">"Deliberate Discovery"</a>.<br />
Ignorance is usually the &nbsp;main bottleneck in software projects (ignorance about the business domain, ignorance about the technology, ignorance about the real goals and hidden agendas, ignorance about the team ...)<br />
Usually we are even dealing with second order ignorance: We are ignorant how ignorant we are!<br />
The only option we have is to embrace our ignorance. The earlier accept this the better.<br />
