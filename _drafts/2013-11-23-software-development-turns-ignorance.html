This summer I finished my post graduate studies at MAS MTEC ETH. I am still pondering if those two years were time well spent.<br />
I think the nature of learning is changing rapidly in the world of today. Long dedicated blocks of education where you learn something to apply afterwards make less and less sense today. The world is changing too fast and contexts are too different today. Learning has to have an effective feedback loop. This becomes more and more relevant as more and more work is evolving into a pure knowledge industry.<br />
In the software industry we all had to embraced this fact some time ago: The times where you just had to know two books to be a competent programmer are long gone. But not only technologies, frameworks and programming languages are changing on a yearly basis. Also methodologies and management frameworks are changing very fast. We all have witnessed the rise and fall of Agile/Scrum in the last decade.<br />
The consequence is the need for continuous learning. There is no separation between learning and working. Working is learning, learning is working. That is what a knowledge worker is doing.<br />
Workers and businesses have to embrace continuous learning and optimise for it. Efficiency and success will be a result how well the learning process is optimised.<br />
This is where the Web currently is revolutionising learning: At least for the software industry there is already an abundance of high-quality learning content available on the web. Web based learning has many advantage of traditional course-based learning:<br />
<ul>
<li>You don't have to travel: Web content can be consumed everywhere. You don't loose time to get to the course venue.</li>
<li>It can be consumed at any time: You are free to create your own schedule. And you are flexible to change it.</li>
<li>Lessons are typically split up into smaller, consumable chunks: You can adjust learning to your own rhythm and schedule.</li>
<li>A lot of the content is available for free!</li>
</ul>
<div>
All the above points really stimulate continuous learning: You are commuting daily half an hour? Perfect for watching screencasts! You have some dead time waiting for feedback before you can continue your work: Start watching a presentation! You are tired and need a creative break? Go on continue with that presentation. You are running twice a week 5km: Perfect for a podcast.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
For myself I try to live the above advice: I almost always listen to podcasts when commuting. For longer train rides I regularly watch screencasts. My home-trainer is set-up for watching presentations:</div>

<div>
The available content for learning is vast. I already call it "Education Overflow". I have to pick and choose, there is no way consuming everything that is interesting.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
Currently I have the following list of content I regularly consume:</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
InfoQ</div>
<div>
YouTube</div>
<div>
Vimeo</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
TekPub</div>
<div>
PeepCode</div>
<div>
Pluralsight</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
Let's Code Javascript</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
iTunesU</div>
<div>
Udacity</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
Coursera</div>
<div>
Kahn Academy</div>
<br />
<br />
Businesses should get much more involved in the learning process of their employees. The current "education programs" of the companies I know are still very "20th century like": If you want to learn something you typically have to go to a course or certification. For that you have to hand in a request to your boss. Since the course is during regular work-time and typically costs a non-trivial amount, it has to be planned and synchronised on various schedules and budgets (maybe you are too late and it gets postponed to next year?).<br />
This is not what I call optimise for leaning!<br />
I think companies that take software development seriously should give their employes free access to PluralSight (or something similar) by default. That would already be a huge motivation for typical alpha-geeky employees. They would happily invest lots of their free time to learn new stuff.<br />
As a second step companies should encourage employees to learn. Giing them free access to Pluralsight alone, might not always be enough. Giving them some slots during their paid work time where that they can use for learning will be the next step. This is still a much more efficient approach than the traditional way of sending employees to courses: It is cheaper, employees can schedule their learning slots more flexible and they can optimise the content (you can't fast-forward in a traditional course!). Of course this assumes some trust in employees, but that is the base for any knowledge work anyways (see Drucker's quote at the beginning).
