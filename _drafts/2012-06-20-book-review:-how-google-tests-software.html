<a href="http://amzn.to/NTX1WB">How Google Tests Software</a><br />
&nbsp;This is a very interesting book, however don't expect to know how google tests software after reading this book.<br />
<br />
A lot of concepts. Nothing really new, but you start to believe that it is actually working at Google.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I got the feeling that the book is not very consistent, sometimes even a bit contradicting.<br />
<br />
The most interesting two things for me were:<br />
It seems the most natural thing that testers at Google are reading the source code of the product they are testing. They actually analyse changes in the source control repository to ecide what to test. I think that is very sensible, I just have never come across a company whre this actually was done. In al the different enterprise projects I was working on, testers were far away from the source. In almost all they cases they would not have been able to read source code, but even in the rare cases where they would have been able to read source code, they were technically not enabled to get at the sources... &nbsp; <br />
<br />
<br />
TDD is hardly a topic. It is only casually mentioned, that some developers do TDD. This is of course according to the fact, that TDD is not a testing discipline. But since the book also puts a heavy weigtht on making clear that developers and not testers own the quality and discusses how developers can produce quality software, it can be concluded that TDD is not consdered a relevant factor contributing to quality (of course this does not mean that its useless!).<br />
<br />
The thing that is a bit annoying about the book is the fact that it really does not miss the slightest opportunity to mention and repeat that Google is paradise on earth and o so great to work at. After half of the book you really got the picture and repainting the picture of happy and greatful Googlers just starts to get boring.<br />
This even gets a bit ironic when reading the interview with James Witacker, the primary author of the book, where he is extensively praising Google as beeing the coolest company... but knowing that he has left Google in the meantime and went back to Microsoft (where he worked before joining this coolest company) and leaving some <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jw_on_tech/archive/2012/03/13/why-i-left-google.aspx">bitter comments about Google</a>.<br />
