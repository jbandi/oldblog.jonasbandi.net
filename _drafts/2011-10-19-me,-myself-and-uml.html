<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/jonas.bandi/R5pO1ddfetI/AAAAAAAAAGI/v63zUxS3kGQ/MEvsUML.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="MEvsUML.jpg" width="270" height="106" /></div><p><br /><br /> UML is a monstrous beast with many heads and countless powers. I generally don't feel comfortable when a complex thing like UML gets marginalized to a simple evidence like "I know UML!". <br /><br /> Recently I tried to find my position towards UML. The copycat I am, I try to summarize the points that are important to me by quoting people hat are much smarter than me: <br /><br /></p><p>From <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2008/01/22/the-post-it-reg-notes-test-for-uml-diagrams">Object Mentor</a>:</p><li> [...]the design is likely to change quite a bit as you learn while coding. Hardly anyone returns to the diagrams and updates them. Now they are lies, because they make claims about the designs that aren’t true. [...] </li><p> </p><li> [...] It’s a great tool for brainstorming design ideas. [...] </li><p> </p><li> [Don't] feel bad about lost work if you eventually throw it away. </li><p><br /> From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Applying-UML-Patterns-Introduction-Object-Oriented/dp/0131489062/ref=pd_sim_b_img_3">Applying UML and Patterns</a>:</p><p><br /><br /> From <a href="http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=130">Death by UML Fever</a>: <br /> much use of UML is waste - it's plain artifact generation. It's not Lean and it's not agile! <br /><br /> From <a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a>: <br /><br /><br /></p><p>http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UmlMode.html <br /><br /> http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UmlAsSketch.html <br /> Your aim is to use the sketches to help communicate ideas and alternatives about what you're about to do. <br /> The tools used for sketching are lightweight drawing tools <br /><br /> http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/UnwantedModelingLanguage.html <br /> http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PlatformIndependentMalapropism.html <br /><br /> http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/ModelDrivenArchitecture.html <br /><br /></p><p>* Much of the boosting of UML seems to be based on the statement that pictures are better than text. In cases this is true, but I see no evidence for that in general - anyone who has compared flow charts to pseudo code can form their own conclusions. <br /><br /> I would really like to see software development raised by a level of abstraction. But I don't see that the UML provides this abstraction jump . <br /><br /> http://littletutorials.com/2008/05/15/13-reasons-for-umls-descent-into-darkness/</p><p> </p><p>Michael Feather:<br />http://michaelfeathers.typepad.com/michael_feathers_blog/2011/06/uml-out-of-the-box.html</p><p>There isn't much to UML. It's just boxes and lines. <br />A long time ago, people did try to turn UML into a big thing.  You're better off not knowing what they did. <br />Sketch. Forget about UML generating tools. They are a pain.</p><p> </p>
