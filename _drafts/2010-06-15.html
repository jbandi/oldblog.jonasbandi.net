Debugging is a skill that should not be desired!<br />- <a href="http://archive.oredev.org/topmenu/video/keynotebobmartin.4.5a2d30d411ee6ffd28880002007.html">Uncle Bob, Oredev 2008</a><br /><br />In my testing courses I recite the above quote. I that I think today still much time and effort is wasted in the debugger and this effort which is not effective.<br /><br />I argue that proper TDD (respectively growing the software guided by tests) has a much more sustainable effect and prevents excessive debugging.<br /><br />As part of that TODO Defect-Driven-Development then can be applied for fixing bugs, again helping to reduce excessive debugging sessions.<br /><br />However I think a good debugger is very valuable when exploring new APIs. Even very expressive APIs are better understood when you can poke and probe them at runtime. There a debugger can be very helpful.<br /><br />I usually approach this with writing Exploration Tests that allow me to access the given API directly and efficiently. I write assertions that formulate my expectations, this is helps me to get a clear picture of my current understanding of the API. <br />If the test fails I quickly rerun it the debugger to inspect hat is really going on and to update my understanding. Based on that I can update my assertions.<br /><br />An interesting question for which I don't have an answer is: Should I keep these tests in the solution or should I delete them again after having explore the API and got it integrated into my application.<br />The advantage with leaving them is documentation, regression-testing against the api and a base for further explorations.<br />The disadvantage is obviously that it makes your solution obese and maybe your exploration tests are sometimes rather quick and dirty and deserve no place in a clean project ;-)<br /><br />What do you think?
