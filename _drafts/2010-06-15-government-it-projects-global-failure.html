<p><a href="http://twitter.com/keithb_b">Keith Braithwaite</a> leads a little <a href="http://peripateticaxiom.blogspot.com/2010/05/government-it-projects-who-can.html">crusade against the miserable state of government IT projects</a> in the UK (<a href="http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/ITProcessReview/">see the petition</a>):</p><blockquote>It has been estimated that the ten worst IT project failures under Labour cost the country around <a href="http://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/news/news-government-it/cost-of-labours-botched-it-projects-exposed-3076">£26  billion</a>. That's half the annual budget for schools.</blockquote><p> </p><p>I suspect that the problem is not only present in the UK and that we should also care very much about this in our own countries.</p><p>The sad thing is, that the mismanagement and dilettantism is so plain obvious, but nobody is addressing them.</p><p>Why is that?</p><p>I guess one problem is that there is too much money available and no clear stakeholders.</p><p>So everybody is content with the status quo since the money is flowing.</p><p>I really hope that the public attention is drawn to this! Public attention would involve the tax-payer as a stakeholder which hopefully would increase pressure...</p><p>Keith has an <a href="http://peripateticaxiom.blogspot.com/2010/01/uk-goverment-it-failures.html">interesting anaysis in his post</a>:</p><blockquote>It would be easy to conclude that large government IT projects fail primarily for technical reasons. Technical mistakes certainly are made, but the root cause of many failed projects seems to be the procurement process with which they begin. <strong>The question which is asked of the suppliers is not one that allows for the kind of answer that leads to success.</strong> It is well known in the private sector that <strong>very large monolithic projects have little chance of success</strong>, but this is the only kind for which the Civil Service seems to know how to ask.  [emphasis mine]</blockquote><p> </p><p> </p>
