<blockquote>
<p>Once you understand that software is not a simple pile of bricks, you understand that the minimum level of competence required to contribute positively to a project is non-trivial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this essay should be a “must read” for anyone involved into software development. It shows the problems with the widespread mentality that developing a piece of software is like building something fairly simple out of bricks.<br>
One point which shows the fundamental difference between laying bricks and software development particularly stuck with me: Skilled developers typically come up with solutions that are simpler and consist of less code than less skilled developers. This does not fit a “brick mentality”, where you have a fixed amount of bricks to move.</p>

<p>There is already a <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4765">pull request</a> to make Node.js run on ChakraCore. And there is a new <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node-chakracore">node-chakracore repo</a> under the Node.js Foundation. Unfortunately it seems that it is only working on windows for now …</p>

<p>Of course the title is link-bait and the article is provocative. But it is still a good comparison between the different approaches and concepts used in Angular2 and React.</p>

The talk gives a good overview to different approaches for data-binding in current web-frameworks. It also explains the concept and benefits of using a virtual dom.
