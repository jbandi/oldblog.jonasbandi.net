Actually. there seem to be quite some reasons why not to use micorservices. I like the dicussion, however I think it’s not specific to microservices, but applies to any decoubled service-oriented architecture … any many failed SOA projects have probably suffered from the pitfalls described.</p><h3 id="the-salary-of-programmers"><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-complang">The Salary of Programmers</a></h3><p>It was a topic already in <a href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2015/04/weekend-reader-14.html">my last weekend reader</a>. This week we get more information about that topic from the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015">Stackoverflow Developer Survey 2015</a>. There are many interesting/surprising insights: <br />
- Developers in the US are much better paid than in Western Europe  <br />
- Objective-C and Node.js development pays best.  <br />
- You should not be a Java developer if you are in it for the money. <br />
- Developers who work remotely earn significantly more than non-remote workers (probably this is a symptom not a cause: good developers are hired for remote work) <br />
- Mobile developers are more satisfied with their job than other developers.  <br />
- Product manager and quality assurance are among the least satisfying jobs</p><h3 id="the-rise-of-typescript"><a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/the-rise-of-typescript/">The Rise of TypeScript</a></h3><p>The decision of the Angular team to build Angular 2 with <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> and to treat TypeScript as the best way to write Angular applications puts a lot of momentum behind the TypeScript language. With this step TypeScript will almost certainly leave its current Microsoft-centric niche and be more widely adopted among web developers.</p><h3 id="javascript-for-desktop-application-development"><a href="https://github.com/atom/atom-shell">JavaScript for Desktop Application Development</a></h3><p>Many developers will cringe at that notion.
