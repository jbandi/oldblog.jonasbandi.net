    <blockquote style="font-size: 14px;">
Programming is very difficult. To do it well requires a phenomenal amount of commitment. To motivate yourself and keep yourself committed, you need to have pride in what you're doing. If instead you consider yourself a mechanical assembly line worker, [...] then you're not going to have enough interest in what you're doing to do it well.</blockquote>

<blockquote style="font-size: 14px;">
If your commitment doesn’t encompass a genuine passion 
for the work at hand, it becomes a void that is almost impossible to 
conceal, no matter how elaborately or attractively designed it is. </blockquote>

Study after study has shown that motivation probably has a larger effect on productivity and quality than any other factor.

Commitment is the key for success! This is my firm personal belief!
<br />
<br />
Sometimes <a href="http://closed-loop.blogspot.com/search?q=commitment">I wonder</a> if I am wrong ... but then I find evidence that others share my belief.
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29">Scrum</a> is one such evidence. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29">Scrum</a> defines pigs and chickens. Pigs are committed, chickens are just involved:
<br />

</div>
<br />
This is not just a joke, without this fundamental role perception Scrum does not work! Everybody involved really has to understand, what it means to be a pig and a chicken.<br />
<br />
If one pig starts behaving like a chicken the others have no choice but to gradually follow... we are entering the <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/fixitP.html">broken-window-cycle</a>.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net.au/ebooks01/0100011h.html">But some animals are more equal than others</a>! This is also true for the scrum-pigs: If an unworthy developer-pigglet feels that it wants to hatch and chatter like a chicken, this can easily be corrected or overlooked.

<br />
But when the mighty scrum-master-boar or the grand product-owner-sow starts swinging his imaginary wings and bouncing from pole to pole, then all the little developer-piglets have no choice but to follow!

... jumping out of the allegory ...
<br />
<br />
If the product-owner or the scrum-master (they may also be called customer and project-leader) give the impression that they are not committed to the project, the developer only has two options:
<br />
<br />
<i>Either</i> he starts committing even more, trying to compensate for the lack of commitment of the others. This is usually a very frustrating and sometimes even self-destructive endeavor.
<br />
<br />
<i>Or</i> he begins himself not to care. This often a subconscious act of self-protection. But the result is the typical project-setup in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikado_%28game%29">mikado</a>-style (whoever moves, looses) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Maid">queen-of-spades</a>-style (pass the blame as fast as possible).
