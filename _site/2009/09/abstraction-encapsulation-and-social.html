<blockquote>Hiding things from developers often requires more effort in the long run than simply trying to educate your developers as to how they should properly do their job.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Making development "safe" for lesser skilled developers by taking choices away from developers [...] does far more to hamper the efforts of your best developers than it does to make weaker developers more productive.
I'll say that there is a silver bullet(s), it's: Skill. Knowledge. Experience. Passion. Discipline.</blockquote>

<br/>

Again and again I come across projects, teams and companies that misuse the concepts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_%28computer_science%29">Abstraction</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding">Encapsulation</a> to establish a two class society among the developers.
<br/>
<br/>

<img style="margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px"src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_X3kaawac_g4/SsHokfvFdCI/AAAAAAAAAqU/z4-LrYlJhUw/mind_the_gap-logo.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="mind_the_gap-logo.jpg" border="0" width="190" align="right" />
In those setups you usually find on one side a framework-team that is responsible for a supposedly productivity-boosting, supposedly well crafted framework / platform / infrastructure. On the other side you find an army of business programmers that have to use the provided framework / platform / infrastructure to actually realize business value.
<br/>
<br/>
Usually the framework-team members think of themselves as the gurus, the elite, the "real" programmers, while the business programmers are considered as "lesser" foot soldiers.
<br/>
These attitudes are mostly shared and therefore promoted by management. Indeed the framework-programmers often have the better education and/or more technical expertise.
<br/>
If the situation is really bad then the framework team does not like to mingle with the business-programmers and the worst thing is, when they are not even co-located.
<br/>
<br/>
<img style="margin: 10px 10px 0px 0px"src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/jonas.bandi/SFrOQe6K3gI/AAAAAAAAAPo/bWF2jNFEr3U/Teamwork.gif?imgmax=800" alt="Teamwork.gif" border="0" width="140" align="left" />
I heavily oppose this setup. It is an antipattern, that prevents team enabling. Agile, self-enabling, highly-motivated teams will never evolve in such a structured and divided team setup. This is not an environment where individuals are allowed to grow, this is an environment where employees are assigned! <strong>In such an environment, people just start to not care any more:</strong> framework-developers do not really care about business value, business-developers dont't feel like being able to make a difference...
<br/>
<br/>

<a href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2008/01/why-software-factory-analogy-fails.html">As I don't believe in the factory analogy</a>, I don't believe there is a situation where lesser developers have to be shielded/protected by a technical framework. The time to create a patronizing framework, would be better invested in teaching and exchanging knowledge.
<br/>
In my experience, if a developer is not productive, then this is usually a management failure. Simple measures like assigning another task,  changing the setup, pair programming, coaching, reviews etc. would usually improve the situation. I have seen projects where this has been achieved successfully, but in the above setup, this is usually not going to happen.
<br/>
And in the rare case that you are really dealing with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NNPP">net negative producing programmer (NNPP)</a>, no technological solution will save you...

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)">Abstraction</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding">Encapsulation</a> are pillars of object-oriented design. They are intellectual constructs to tackle complexity. They are technical tools and <em>not a mechanism to legitimate team structure</em>.
<br/>

<br/>
Using engineering techniques from object-oriented design to enforce team structure and separation feels just as wrong as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_darwinism">applying Darwin's evolution theory to human societies</a>.
<br/>
<br/>

Possible remedies and counter measures for the situation are:

<list>
<li>
<strong>Eat your own dogfood:</strong> Framework-developers have to use their own framework. They have to be involved in business-programming.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Empower the business developers:</strong> Establish an environment where it is absolutely clear, that the business developers are the ones that are providing value. 
The framework-team has the sole purpose to enable the business-developers.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Productize the framework:</strong> Nobody is forced to use the framework. The framework-programers have to actively sell their work, the business developers can freely decide if they want to use it. (According to a disscussion with Mark Striebeck, this philosophy is very successful at Google)
</li>
<li>
<strong>Collective ownership of the code</strong>, including the framework.
</li>
</list>
